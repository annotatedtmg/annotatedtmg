[^juhujohn]:
    John's commentary on the forum about the album:

    > people are free to fileshare this if they like, even here - it's out of
    > print, and is going to remain out of print forever, since the cool-ass
    > packaging would be unfeasible at a larger level (the sleeves were
    > handsewn) and I'm not interested in seeing it packaged any other way
    >
    > I am fond of this release, it's really different and out-there and some
    > of the songs were heading in directions that I didn't end up pursuing
    > further - makes me wonder how a cycle I was working on concurrently
    > ("Montenegrin Suite," of all the pretentious titles in the world) might
    > have turned out if other work hadn't reared its head"

    Given that the album is now available on iTunes, purchasing there rather
    than downloading is preferable. For people who want to recreate the album,
    an awesome project containing instructions for how to duplicate everything
    about it is available [on the
    wiki](http://themountaingoats.net/wiki/doku.php?id=diyojb:home).

[^multirelease]:
    Originally, the album was an extremely limited release by Nursecall.
    However, there may be multiple releases. Some [discussion by people who
    own the
    album](http://www.mountain-goats.com/forums/read.php?2,4186,page=2)
    revealed that there are both professionally printed and sans label
    versions both bought officially from Nursecall. All are in the
    middleweight canvas packaging on a 3" CD.

    By 2008, it was released on iTunes by Yoyo, who apparently now own the
    copyright. John himself was surprised by the release, which was apparently
    not orchestrated by him.

[^juhu]:
    Juhu Beach is a prominent beach on the Arabian Sea in
    [Juhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juhu), a district or suburb of Mumbai
    on the west coast of India. Despite the Japanese packaging, I'm not aware
    of a Juhu Beach in Japan.

### Liner notes [^liner] [^poster] ### {#liner}

*(paper 1):*

5 songs recorded in iowa \\
10/99 -- 02/00

*(paper 2):*

訳詩　宮川一春 (jamaican cheek) [^cheek]

*(paper 3)*:

また早いうちにいっしょにあいましょうと望う。 \\
ジョン・ダーニェルより \\
\<John's signature\> \\
五月一日 \\
アメリカ・アイオワ州にて [^seeyou]

[^liner]:
    The liner notes are contained on a photocopy that was folded inside the
    sewn record, appearing to be cut and pasted pieces of paper with typed
    Japanese kanji characters on top of a parcel air package mailed by the
    United States Postal Service in Ames, Iowa to Nursecall in Japan. You can
    see what this looks like [on Caliclimber's Flickr
    page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/caliclimber/2986267181/).

    Almost everything on the page is in Japanese. When translated back into
    English, most of the text turns out to be the lyrics to the songs. For
    those who are interested in reading the translated and modified lyrics
    (and the somewhat hilarious results you sometimes get translating them
    back into English), you can [see the lyrics and their translations
    here](mirror/juhu-liner.html). Some lyrics are completely different or
    have some additional meanings in the Japanese translations; I've annotated
    these in the individual songs when significant. Above, I've included all
    of the liner notes but the lyrics and the basic biographical information
    written in English.

    Two particular pieces of paper are of note. One reads:

    > 別紙１
    >
    > 別紙―「歌の説明」

    This translates as "Appendix 1: Appendix --- 'Explanations of the songs'".
    The rest of that piece of paper provides some brief perspectives on the
    first two songs, Hotel Road and Bad Waves. The second piece of paper reads
    "別紙２", meaning "Appendix 2", and describes the remaining songs,
    Transjordanian Blues, Burned My Tongue, and World Cylinder. These
    commentaries are included with each song.

[^poster]:
    On Juhu Beach also had a promotional poster (viewable [on Nall's
    site](http://www.themountaingoats.net/pics/juhu_poster.jpg)).
    Unfortunately, the Japanese is sufficiently obscured as to render it
    untranslatable. If you have access to this poster and could send me a
    photo of the Japanese text, I'd love to translate it.

[^cheek]:
    This translates as "Lyrics translated by Kazuharu Miyagawa". Jamaican
    Cheek is Miyagawa's really, really awesome Japanese postrock band, and you
    should [go listen to their awesome
    music](https://soundcloud.com/jamaican-cheek). They rock.

[^seeyou]:
    Translates to be:

    > I hope to see you again soon. \\
    > \<John's signature\> \\
    > May 1 \\
    > Iowa, USA

## Hotel Road [^hoteljohn] ## {#hotel}

Thirty-story hotel overlooking the sea \\
Friends on either arms supporting me [^power] \\
It's hard to walk now \\
But I will go down somehow \\
I'm going down the old road \\
I'm going down the old road

Children kick a soccer ball around in the street [^without] \\
Kalpadruma trees [^kalpadruma] melting in the heat \\
It's hard to walk here \\
Where the waves shine so clear \\
I'm going down the old road \\
I'm going down, down the old road

Above the swollen ocean, the burning yellow sun \\
Hits the hotel's Mylar windows [^mylar] catching everyone [^attack] \\
It's hard to say why \\
I should come here to die \\
I'm going down the old road \\
I'm going down the old road

[^hoteljohn]:
    From the [Japanese liner notes](#fn:liner):

    > 1\. Hotel Road.
    > 老僧はインドにあるホテルの高い階の窓から海を見て、独りで歌う。

    In English, this reads, "Hotel Road: An old monk sings alone looking over
    the ocean from a hotel window of an upper floor in India."

[^power]:
    In the [Japanese lyrics](#fn:liner), written as "Please, someone lend me
    some power".

[^without]:
    Written in the [Japanese lyrics](#fn:liner) as "Children are playing
    soccer on the street without any thought for the people around them".

[^kalpadruma]:
    Kalpadruma tree is another name for the [kalpavriksha
    tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpavriksha), a mythological wish
    tree in Hinduism granted by Parvati, being formed in the churning of the
    ocean of milk that created many other holy plants, animals, and artifacts.
    It does not have a clear botanical counterpart.

[^mylar]:
    [Mylar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoPET), a brand name for
    biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate, is a reflective plastic
    sheet material presumably used here to reflect the sun.

[^attack]:
    [In Japanese](#fn:attack), written as "Shattering the Mylar windows of the
    hotel, and starting to attack everyone".

## Bad Waves [^wavesjohn] ## {#waves}

Beachfront hotel \\
Twenty dollars a night \\
1972 \\
Sun yellow and bright [^enough] \\
Too exhausted to think or to talk \\
Young boys from Bangladesh [^bangladesh] \\
Breakdancing on the sidewalk \\
And the waves will tear them all to pieces \\
The waves will tear them all to pieces

Twinkling Waterford crystal [^waterford] \\
In the banquet hall \\
Childlike religious paintings [^hanuman] \\
Lining the wall \\
I will try to gather my strength \\
And I will rest up all week \\
All I can say to them, yeah \\
When I open my mouth to speak, is that the waves \\
Will tear us all to pieces \\
The waves will tear us all to pieces

[^wavesjohn]:
    Written in Japanese in [the liner](#fn:liner), John states:

    > 2\. Bad Waves.
    > 彼は学生について話をしようとしている。しかし、いいたい話がいえないと心配しています。

    Translated back into English, this reads, "He is trying to talk about (a)
    student(s), but is worried/concerned that he cannot express himself in the
    story as he wants to." The translator commented to me that as Japanese
    lacks singular and plural forms and as this short explanation doesn't
    provide enough context, it's unclear whether it should read student or
    students.

[^enough]:
    These lines are rearranged in the [Japanese transcription](#fn:liner).
    This line is removed entirely, replaced by "That's enough", after the line
    describing the price.

[^bangladesh]:
    [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh) is a country
    bordering India to the northeast, formed in 1947 as part of Pakistan and
    gaining independence as Bangladesh in 1971.

[^waterford]:
    [Waterford Crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterford_Crystal) is a
    major Irish crystal manufacturer.

[^hanuman]:
    [Written in Japanese](#fn:liner) as "Childish Hanuman pictures drawn on
    the walls".

    [Hanuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman) is a monkey-headed Hindu
    god loyal to Rama and fighting against Ravana in the epic *Ramayana*.

## Transjordanian Blues [^transjordanianjohn] [^transjordanianseries] [^transjordan] ## {#transjordanian}

*"One, two, three, four."*

This church is rotten from the top down \\
This church is rotten from the top down \\
But I, I am going to clean house tonight \\
And it's going to go back into the earth it rose from

These walls can't keep the world at bay \\
No, these walls can't keep the world at bay \\
Our time, our time is limited and precious \\
And this place, this place is limitless and pernicious

Would you all just follow me \\
Out into the open \\
Leave your coats and handbags, damn it all \\
Can't you see the floors are smoking [^shit]

Yeah, this church is not long for this world \\
This church is not long for this world \\
If you're wondering who to blame, I want to praise his name with songs and feasting \\
Follow me to the open field, where the truth will be revealed if you're really listening

Hosanna, hosanna [^hosanna] \\
I am saved by the blood of the lamb [^lamb] \\
Yeah, one day when I was lost \\
He died upon that cross [^theblood] \\
And I am saved by the blood of the lamb

[^transjordanianjohn]:
    John writes in the [liner notes](#fn:liner):

    > 3\. Transjordanian Blues.
    > 説教であり、その半分は全くの絶望で、もう半分は無条件の称賛である。

    Translated, this reads, "Transjordanian Blues is a sermon; half of which
    is complete despair and the other half is unconditional praise."

[^transjordanianseries]:
    Transjordanian Blues is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^transjordan]:
    This is a complex reference that could take meaning from several sources,
    all of some Biblical importance.

    The first, and most obvious, are from the geographical regions of
    [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan) and
    [Transjordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transjordan_(Bible)), all
    referring to lands bordering and east of the [Jordan
    River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_River). Jordan is a
    present-day country as well as an ancient region bordering modern
    Palestine, Israel, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. Transjordan is a Biblical term
    for Gilead, referring to the land owned by the Israeli tribes of Reuben,
    Gad, and Manasseh. The term literally translates to "across the Jordan" in
    Latin, coming from a Hebrew word for the same.

    Interpreted as, "Blues from crossing Jordan", this could refer to a number
    of Biblical events. Most prominent of these would be the crossing of the
    river Jordan after their exodus from Egypt, in which the waters recede to
    allow their crossing during the floods. Less obviously, this could refer
    to Jesus crossing Jordan to speak (or people crossing Jordan to hear him),
    or most importantly, his hiding place, which was described as being at the
    place of John the Baptist's baptismal site, "across the Jordan".

[^shit]:
    Translated [in the Japanese](#fn:liner) as "Shit, don't you realize it's
    smoking from the floor?"

[^hosanna]:
    Hosanna is a word meaning "save" or "rescue" in Hebrew and Aramaic, used
    in modern Christianity and Judaism services as an plea for divine help. It
    appears in numerous Bible verses, particularly [the triumphal return of
    Jesus to
    Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumphal_entry_into_Jerusalem),
    in which it serves as a joyous shout by the welcoming crowds. This story
    is told in all of the canonical Gospels.

[^lamb]:
    This may be a variation of the lyrics to I Know It Was the Blood
    ([described below](#fn:theblood)), however, I haven't been able to find
    lyrics with these lines in them. More likely, these lines are John
    referring to the salvation of humanity through the crucifixion of Christ
    (at least, to those that ascribe to substitutionary atonement).

    The line blends several references. First, the [lamb of
    God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_of_God) is a term for Jesus, first
    uttered by John the Baptist upon first seeing Jesus: "Here is the Lamb of
    God, who takes away the sin of the world!" The blood of the lamb could
    literally refer to the blood spilled by Jesus in his death. However, it
    could also refer to lines in Revelation, many of which follow the Lamb, an
    apparently slain beast as it carries out Revelation in a metaphor for
    Jesus. Specifically, Revelation 7:14 states: "These are the ones coming
    out of the great tribulation. They washed their robes and made them white
    in the blood of the Lamb."

    1:29](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A29&version=HCSB);

    7:14](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+7%3A14&version=HCSB).

[^theblood]:
    A direct quote from the gospel song I Know It Was the Blood, which
    contains these lines in every verse. Different traditions sing different
    lyrics, but at an example, here is one version of the first verse:

    > I know it was the blood, \\
    > I know it was the blood, \\
    > I know it was the blood for me. \\
    > One day when I was lost \\
    > He died upon the cross, \\
    > I know it was the blood for me.

    The song describes how the death of Jesus resulted in the salvation of all
    sinners.

## Burned My Tongue [^tonguejohn] ## {#tongue}

Woke up this morning about a quarter to five \\
Said the prayer you taught me to keep myself alive [^liveitup] \\
It burned my tongue \\
It burned my tongue

Fried some grains in butter, said a simple grace \\
Sat down at the table, fed my greedy face \\
It burned my tongue \\
It burned my tongue

Looked out at the ocean, I could see it so clear \\
Said the only name I can ever stand to hear [^couldnt] \\
It burned my tongue \\
It burned my tongue

When I ask you to sing with me, I wish you'd sing along \\
Thirty years in this world, thirty years too long \\
It burns my tongue \\
It burns my tongue

You took away my friends, you took my will to live \\
I gave you all I got, what more have I got to give \\
It burns my tongue \\
It burns my tongue \\
It burns my tongue \\
It burns my tongue

[^tonguejohn]:
    In [the liner notes](#fn:liner), John writes:

    > 4\. Burned My Tongue.
    > 彼は棋（チェス）というゲームの規則は公平であるかどうか神と議論している。

    Which reads, "He is discussing/arguing with God whether or not the rules
    of a game called chess is fair." The character 棋 can be read as chess,
    go, or another abstract strategy game, however, the parenthetical clause
    clarifies that he's referring to Western chess.

[^liveitup]:
    Written [in Japanese](#fn:liner) as "I mumbled the prayer that you taught
    me / Let's live it up today".

[^couldnt]:
    Inverted [in the Japanese translation](#fn:liner), where this line reads,
    "I said that name / I couldn't stand hearing it".

## World Cylinder [^cylinderjohn] ## {#cylinder}

I don't like going to the doctor \\
I don't like looking in the mirror \\
I like looking out the window \\
Watching the waves break \\
Do I have to hit you over the head with it [^punch] \\
Do I have to hit you over the head with it

I'm tired of talking to the suckers [^poor] \\
I'm tired of talking to the wealthy \\
I want to talk to men and women \\
Who haven't got anything left \\
Do I have to hit you over the head with it \\
Do I have to hit you over the head with it

Carry me down to the water \\
Where I used to play when I was five \\
Let me go, let me go down to the water \\
Don't bring me back alive \\
Do I have to hit you over the head with it \\
Do I have to hit you over the head with it

[^cylinderjohn]:
    From [the Japanese liner notes](#fn:liner):

    > 5\. World Cylinder.
    > これは、ダンス音楽。お餞の全然もっていない人しかこの音楽にダンスできない。

    Translated, this says, "This is a dance music. Only those who have
    absolutely no money can dance to this music." I presume that "no money" in
    this context is an Anglicism to be interpreted as "uncool" rather than
    taken literally.

[^poor]:
    "Suckers" is written as "poor" in [the Japanese lyrics](#fn:liner).

[^punch]:
    This refrain is [written in Japanese](#fn:liner) as "Is that why I need to
    punch your head..."
