[^thief]:
    Why You All So Thief? is a split EP with fellow Inland Empire cassette
    musician Simon Joyner, each contributing two tracks. The Simon Joyner
    tracks, Burn Rubber and Fluoride, are not discussed here.

    The title comes from a line in Jamaica Kincaid's autobiographical novel
    (confirmed in the liner notes to Protein Source of the Future... NOW!), [A
    Small Place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Small_Place). Amid her anger
    with corruption in the government of Antigua, where she was born, and its
    exploitation by foreigners, she writes (p. 68):

    The people who go into running the government were not always such big
    thieves; nor have they always been so corrupt. They took things, but it
    was on a small scale. For instance, if the government built some new
    housing to be sold to people, then a minister or two would get a few of
    the houses for themselves. They would then sell them outright, or rent
    them. Everybody knew about this. Some of the ministers were honest. One of
    them, a famous one in Antigua, a leader of the Trade and Labour Union
    movement, even died a pauper. Another minister, when his party lost power,
    had to drive a taxi. It is he, the taxi-driving ex-minister, who taught
    the other ministers a lesson. If you say to them, "Why you all so thief?"
    they say, "When I leave here, you want me to go drive taxi?"

    A similar title, [Why You So
    Monkey?](http://www.wckrspgt.com/spgt/discography/cash_nexus_why_you_so_monkey.html),
    belongs to a Cash Nexus album and song released in 1996, Cash Nexus being
    one of the Wckr Spgt related Inland Empire bands. I'm unclear if there's
    any further relationship between the albums.

## Going to Tennessee [^bothjohn] [^tennesseeseries] ## {#tennessee}

Baseball season'll be starting soon \\
But we have no baseball team here \\
I got a house on the river \\
I can see Arkansas [^arkansas] from where I am

The dogs are gathering \\
And the birds are chattering \\
And the sun is setting on Memphis [^memphis] \\
And the sun is setting on Memphis

The medicine bottle collection on the windowsill \\
Shakes when the cars go past on Interstate 55 [^i55] \\
You are standing above me \\
You washed your face with that apricot scrub again \\
I am glad I am alive \\
And your skin is warming up \\
And my skin is warming up \\
And the sun is setting on Memphis \\
And the sun is setting on Memphis

[^bothjohn]:
    "Both songs \[on Why You All So Thief?\] are about cheating death, an
    effort which, you'll note, has yet to meet with success anywhere, ever."

## Pure Heat [^bothjohn] [^heatseries] ## {#heat}

The wind from the north \\
Battens the yellow corn \\
You come in to the house \\
With your dress torn

I can see you now \\
As though through a screen \\
A smile on your face \\
Your fingers dripping kerosene

Your hair hangs down \\
Over me \\
Your hair casts a shadow \\
To cover me

I can see you now \\
As though through a screen \\
A smile on your face \\
Your fingers dripping kerosene

And the wind from the north \\
Cools me \\
The wind from the north \\
Doesn't fool me

I can see you now \\
As though through a screen \\
A smile on your face \\
Your fingers dripping kerosene
