[^bittermelon]:
    [Bitter melon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momordica_charantia),
    *Momordica charantia*, is a vine native to Asia whose warty, cucumber-like
    fruit is eaten throughout the world. It generally has a bitter flavor,
    hence the name, having a short edible period before it ripens and becomes
    too unpleasant to eat.

__YOU GOT ANY GUM?__

I was in a Sam Goody's [^goody] in Ames [^ames] thumbing through the bargain
bin when I saw what I'd been looking for: Robert Redford narrating field
recordings of the sounds of the North American wolf. [^wolves] This was the
same record that my grandmother got for free when she renewed her subscription
to National Geographic back in 1974, and its cover was forever burned into my
brain --- the black mountain, the yellow sky, the silhouette of the wolf
howling at the setting sun. That the record had ever been made bore witness to
a different time, one whose nature is hard to describe but which has to it a
very distinctive taste. It's the same taste that rises in your throat when you
see the footage of that guy trying to set the water speed record on Loch Ness
in '74 or '75 [^cobb] --- the speedboat's moving, and it's moving faster, and
then it's really hauling ass, and then it does a quick flip in the air and
submerges itself beneath the inky water in the blink of an eye.

I remember watching that footage on my grandmother's television, sitting on
the floor in her bedroom, the ceramic owl atop her space heater glowering down
at my eight-year-old body seated cross-legged way to close to the screen.
Suddenly the mysterious Loch Ness Monster [^monster] was being represented as
somehow dangerous, something that hadn't ever occurred to me at all. The
theory ran that the monster was angry about the loch being too noisy and
crowded all the time, and had intentionally upset this guy's boat. They slowed
down the film, and they zoomed in on a small dark disturbance on the already
dark water, and the music was slow and minor and punctuated by shrill strings.
As I remember the film, and the room, and the sounds of my grandmother fixing
dinner in the kitchen two rooms over, the image gets grainier in my mind, the
voice of the narrator lower and harder to hear, and the dust on the screen of
the television becomes vivid, as though viewed through a high-power microscope
lens surgically grafted to the mind's eye. The presentation becomes as ominous
as it was then attempting to be, but it becomes so for reasons quite different
from those its producer had in mind. It is the same year that an underwater
submarine will take a picture of what its pilots will claim was a gigantic
unidentifiable body sailing quickly past its camera, but the picture will look
like a close-up from a pornographic film, all pink and moist and triangular.
[^submarine] They will say it's a fin. I will be unable to interest my friends
in this, except for Brian Plummer, who will have left town by the middle of
the year.

For some reason the songs on this collection of singles and strays remind me
of all that --- they are like a voice saying "Give me some of that" without
any visible referent. Most of you have never eaten a bitter melon. I recommend
that you go to your local Asian market, buy a few, and ask whoever's at the
counter how to cook them. Then go home, follow the cooking instructions you've
received, have a seat near the stereo and make what you will of these songs
while you eat. I recommend a little cayenne pepper to offset the bitter taste.
In the end I did not buy the CD of Robert Redford narrating the sound of the
American Wolf, preferring to spend the rest of my life wishing I had bought
it. Some pleasures are more subtle than others. I hope you find that to be the
case with the songs herein.

--- John Darnielle, Colo, Iowa, March 1999


Thanks to the usual suspects, though I'd like to remember especially the
people who initially released these difficult songs. Peter Hughes, of course,
and Gregor and Herwig; Jeff Smith, Jeff Fuccillo, and WPRB, and Jason
Rothenberg; Jonas Sevenius and all our friends in Sweden; Dan and Danielle
Varenka; Jon Nall, who would like to remind you that UNC completely blows; and
Dennis Callaci, whose early intercession is the only reason that any of this
ever saw the light of day. Front cover: "This box for you. It is Happy Box,"
ink on 20-pound bond by Lalitree Darnielle. Ten bucks says my wife can kick
your wife's ass. The Mountain Goats burn and endorse incense from House of
Mohan, [^businesses] PO Box 64407, Washington DC 2009, who'll send you a
brochure which, among other things, explains in a completely bitchin' one-page
photo essay how essential oils are made; the Mountain Goats order and read
poetry sold at a discount from Spring Church Book Company, PO Box 127, Spring
Church PA 15686, [^businesses] who'll be more than happy to find any book of
poetry you might want to get and who are a small, friendly business deserving
of your patronage. They will send you a catalog if you ask them for one. The
Mountain Goats have always wanted to give out free plugs to people whose good,
fair business practices --- oases of goodness in a weary world filled with
faceless corporate monoliths --- warrant it, but have always let aesthetic
considerations get in their way until now. The Mountain Goats use and endorse
the third person plural and will do so until the cows come home. The Mountain
Goats persist in the belief that eventually the cows will in fact come, and
that they'll stay home once they get there. All songs written by John
Darnielle © 1999 and ℗ 2002 by Cadmean Dawn (ASCAP, except for "Sail On,"
which is by the Commodores, and "The Sign," which God channeled through Ace of
Base. If you've made it all the way down here to the bottom, you get the bonus
question: if there's a mirror standing at the end of the universe, will radio
waves eventually bounce off of it and make their way back to us, and is this
the only way in hell that commercial radio's every going to be any good again?
Send your answers to every radio station in your country and I'll see you next
year in Pompano Beach. [^pompano]

## Noche del Guajolote [^nochejohn] [^walt] [^noche] ## {#noche}

The glowing world, the bench backed up against the house \\
The chicken coops, the darkness surrounding everything

It was late and the night was moving slowly \\
And we lay down on the ground because the world was lonely

If you keep quiet, it'll stay like this forever \\
If you'll just keep quiet, it'll stay like this forever \\
I feel certain of it now

And all the birds were sleeping in their perches \\
A little wind, swaying birches \\
And the North American wild turkey that your father brought home \\
Woke up and came toward us

And the moonlight and the turkey waking up
And the night air and the moonlight on your skin
And the moonlight and the turkey waking up
And the quiet yard and the turkey and the moon
Unimaginable, unimaginable, unimaginable, unimaginable

[^nochejohn]:
    "If I were King, Spandau Ballet's 'Pleasure' would open *Bitter Melon
    Farm*, the Synthesizers cold and sweeping, the bass hammering out its
    octave-leaps grandly, Tony Hadley's voice luring us all toward a watery,
    expensive death, imploring: 'What made you feel like breaking my heart
    tonight?' This idea didn't exactly go over like gangbusters with the boys
    upstairs, though, so you've got a song about a turkey instead, recorded
    live at KSPC Claremont one early summer afternoon when the world was
    simple and people slept with their eyes open." --- Bitter Melon Farm liner
    notes

    [Spandau Ballet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandau_Ballet) was an
    English new wave pop band from the 1970s to 1990. "Pleasure" was the
    opening song of *True*, their most successful album.

[^walt]:
    Originally released on the *I Like Walt* compilation. There, the track is
    billed as:

    > The Mountain Goats with the Bright Mountain Choir
    > Recorded in the Summer of 1993. The Mountain Goats are John, Sarah, Amy,
    > Rachel, and Roseaaaane.

    The compilation was released by Walt Records in 1994.

[^noche]:
    Translated from Spanish, this means "turkey of the night" or "night
    turkey".

## Going to Bangor [^bangorjohn] [^bangorseries] [^army] [^bangor] ## {#bangor}

The ocean wind \\
Cold on our lips \\
The wild fern growing \\
The sinking ships \\
All the signs \\
Are easy to read

In the morning \\
You come my way \\
Your skin is pink \\
The sky is gray \\
There's fresh cranberries \\
In your mouth \\
And thick red water \\
Dripping out \\
You expect me to believe \\
Everything you say \\
Well, OK

[^bangorjohn]:
    "We played this song in Utrecht, Holland, and in my secret heart I'd been
    hoping that the two-piece version of it was going to whip the audience
    into paroxysms of emotion. I had envisioned romantic young Dutch men and
    women taking to the streets, pulling the old men away from their chess
    games and forming them into minor league baseball clubs with names like
    the Dordrecht Wild Ferns or the Ooij Interminable Dysfunctional
    Relationships. Instead the sound man cursed at us because he'd thought
    that we were making fun of the music he'd been playing over the P.A. as we
    took the stage. The music was Guv'ner, and I was not making fun of them. I
    was dancing." --- Bitter Melon Farm liner notes

    [Dordrecht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dordrecht) is a city in the
    Netherlands; Ooij is a village located near
    [Nijmegen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nijmegen).
    [Guv'ner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nijmegen) was an American rock
    group in the 1990s from New York City.

[^bangorseries]:
    Going to Bangor is part of the [Going to ... series](series.html#goingto).

[^army]:
    Originally released on *You and What Army?*, released by Sing, Eunuchs! in
    1994.

[^bangor]:
    Bangor could refer to a number of places, among them a [town in
    Maine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangor,_Maine) and in [Northern
    Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangor,_County_Down), but other
    locations exist elsewhere in the United Kingdom, the United States,
    Canada, Australia, Ireland, and in other locations. I'm not sure which of
    these this song refers to.

## Against Agamemnon [^agamemnonjohn] [^howl] [^agamemnon] [^ajax] ## {#agamemnon}

Red, red \\
Red everywhere \\
Bright red all along \\
The thin canvas wall \\
I stepped outside \\
For a little air \\
Stepped outside \\
To get away from it all \\
Went out through the front \\
I saw the purple sky \\
Making jokes about my condition

I am going for a walk \\
I'll be back in half an hour \\
Watch over the children \\
I'll be back in half an hour \\
Hey, hey, la la la \\
Hey, hey, la la la

[^agamemnonjohn]:
    "This is actually one of two or three favorites out of my innumerable
    songs. If you read the play *Ajax* by Sophocles, its actions will become
    clear as crystal. I feel confident that half of you think I'm lying and
    won't bother to investigate further, and that the other half are direct
    descendants of Sophocles who have been waiting for this moment to indict
    me on charges of copyright infringement." --- Bitter Melon Farm liner
    notes

[^howl]:
    Originally released on *Howl ... a farewell compilation of unreleased
    songs*, released by Glitterhouse in 1994. On the album, the Mountain Goats
    are listed as Rachel, Sara, Roseanne and Aaaamy; the accompanying photo of
    John is captioned The Mountain Goats without Rachel, Sara, Roseanne and
    Aaaamy.

[^agamemnon]:
    [Agamemnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agamemnon) was the mythical king
    of Argos, famous for commanding the Greek forces against Troy during the
    Trojan War, in which Helen, daughter of Zeus and Leda and the wife of
    Menelaus, the king of Sparta and Agamemnon's brother, was kidnapped by
    Paris, king of Troy. According to the *Odyssey*, after returning from the
    Trojan War, he is murdered by the lover of his wife, Clytemnestra; other
    stories have Clytemnestra herself do the killing. Agamemnon and his family
    are marred by many such betrayals and murders, purportedly because of the
    crime committed by Tantalus, his ancestor, whose eternal punishment in
    Tartarus was in retribution for revealing the secrets of the gods to
    humanity.

[^ajax]:
    [*Ajax*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(Sophocles)) is, [as described
    above](#fn:agamemnonjohn), a play by Sophocles which describes Ajax's
    refusal to accept the award of Achilles' armor to Odysseus during the
    Trojan War, plotting instead to kill Agamemnon and Odysseus in revenge.
    During a fit of madness, he tortures and slaughters sheep in his tent,
    thinking they are Agamemnon and Odysseus. Ajax eventually commits suicide
    out of shame after storming out of his tent. My best guess is that this
    describes the scene in which Ajax leaves to commit suicide, but I am far
    from certain. The liner notes to [Transmissions to
    Horace](horace.html#liner) cover a similar theme.

Black mollies in the aquarium \\
Darting back and forth as though an earthquake were certain \\
And I turned up the heater \\
And I ripped off my shirt \\
And I grabbed hold of my stereo \\
And I threw it out the window

You were in town again \\
You'd come around again \\
You were dragging me down again \\
With you

Siamese fighting fish [^betta] flashing like sparklers \\
It started to rain \\
And the telephone rang a couple of times \\
I put a bullet through its cold, dead brain \\
And I got out my photographs of you \\
And I put bullets through all of them too

You were in town again \\
You'd come around again \\
You were dragging me down again \\
Dragging me right down with you

    "Generally speaking, my generation is loath to interpret anything. We
    strive toward the transparent gesture, the act whose meaning is so
    self-evident that absolutely no one misunderstands it. Though this seems
    to me an odd goal, everybody's got to do his part. Allen Callaci is the
    best singer that my generation has produced. This song says as much, takes
    it's ball, and goes home." --- Bitter Melon Farm liner notes

    The compilation was released on vinyl by Union Pole in 1994.

[^hibachi]:
    A [hibachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibachi) is a Japanese heating
    bowl, usually filled with charcoal and used to keep rooms warm. In
    English, it also sometimes refers to a small, flat griddle used as a

## Song for an Old Friend [^friendjohn] [^friendseries] [^wheel] [^goingtorutherford] ## {#friend}

The garter snake passed lazily through the tall yellow-headed sourgrass \\
There was cold, clear water in a tall, clean glass \\
Sunlight hit the sides and it came through the water tilted \\
I saw the condensation on your hand, I could feel the glaciers melting \\
And a warm, soft wind \\
Covered up everything \\
On the day your love came screaming through me

You had oranges and lemons in a canvas bag beside you \\
And seven different kinds of light welling up inside of you \\
You smeared citrus pulp all over me, it felt OK \\
And good old East Rutherford [^rutherford] three thousand miles away \\
I felt a warm surge blast my mind \\
Coming in from behind \\
On the day your love came screaming through me

And in the fresh light of day \\
I felt something falling away \\
On the day your love came screaming through me

[^friendjohn]:
    "This was to have been the first song for a post-Mountain Goats band
    called the Orange Trees, which would have eschewed home recording entirely
    and made slick little pop songs. In the end I decided that getting
    overlooked by one demographic was quite sufficient, thanks. There are some
    people in Canada who are very fond of this song and I love them for it,
    since I have a soft spot for it myself. It could have benefited, however,
    from the vocal stylings of one Tony Hadley." --- Bitter Melon Farm liner

## Snow Song [^johnsnow] [^dog] ## {#snow}

What cars there are \\
Go by like snails \\
And ice crystals shine \\
On the staircase's handrails \\
The quiet air \\
Was worth some discussion \\
As the windows crack \\
And the cold is crushing \\
They've shut down the roads to the coast \\
There's white streets as far as the eye can see \\
And I'd just as soon make you disappear as look at you \\
But I draw you close to me \\
How do you feel about that \\
How do you feel about that

[^johnsnow]:
    "This song's title is, for me, a generic term with a very specific
    purpose. I use it when I've written a song whose mood reminds me, either
    lyrically or musically, of the winter I spent in Portland, Oregon, a
    season during which I almost died at least twice." --- Bitter Melon Farm

## Faithless Bacchant Song [^bacchantjohn] [^years] [^bacchant] ## {#bacchant}

Somewhere in the damn forest \\
Where the fat vines look like my brother's arms \\
Thick and ripe \\
I'm trying to get out for days and these green vines keep getting in my way \\
I came up to a clearing \\
Where the cross currents cooled my face \\
I would have sat down there in the middle \\
I would have rested just a little \\
But for the fire-bellied toads [^toad] \\
See, the ground was wet and they were everywhere \\
Fire-bellied toad number five \\
From what may or may not have been a limited series \\
Opened up his little mouth \\
As though to speak, and then he spoke \\
And then he spoke to me \\
And he said, "You can't holler down our rain barrel \\
You can't climb our apple tree \\
I don't want to play in your yard \\
If you won't be good to me" [^yard] \\
Honey, it was downright creepy

    "You want to know the deep, dark truth about how neurotic I am? I mean do
    you really, really want to know? Fine, then. When Ajax and I started
    discussing reissuing all this stuff, I was of two minds. Mind #1, the
    louder and more punk rock of the two, said: 'Screw reissues. If they
    didn't buy it the first time around, let 'em suffer.' I am often attentive
    to the voice of Mind #1, since I feel a deep personal debt to the people
    who've been faithfully buying every little record that had a Mountain
    Goats song on it since day one. But Mind #2, who's in charge of petty
    resentments, spoke to my vanity, saying: 'The compilation that put out
    'The Faithless Bacchant Song' spelled 'Bacchant' with only one 'c,' and
    everyone who bought it assumes that you don't know how to spell. Boy, do
    they think you're stupid.' Wherefore this tiny song, which is all full of
    faults, is actually in one sense the glue holding the whole thing
    together." --- Bitter Melon Farm liner notes

    Bacchus) the Green god of wine and ritual madness, and so accordingly is
    also used to describe a drunk.

[^yard]:
    A quote from a 19th century folk song called I Don't Want to Play in Your
    Yard, written by Philip Wingate. The chorus goes as follows:

    > I don't want to play in your yard \\
    > I don't like you any more \\
    > You'll be sorry when you see me \\
    > Sliding down our cellar door \\
    > You can't holler down our rain barrel \\
    > You can't climb our apple tree \\
    > I don't want to play in your yard \\
    > If you won't be good to me

    Versions of this song, some with different titles, have been played more
    recently by Peggy Lee, The Puppini Sisters, and other musicians.
