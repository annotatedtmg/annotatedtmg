## Blood Capsules ## {#blood}

*"Whooo!"*\\
*"John Darnielle coming to you live from the main room here at Overdub
playing --- Peter Hughes, Brandon Eggleston, and the Blood Capsules. One, two,
three, and."*

When the last of the East Coast money \\
Ran dry \\
And the casually-dressed bill collectors \\
Started casually dropping on by

And the residuals \\
But there weren't any more residuals \\
At least several months behind \\
On the payments to certain individuals

I strolled into the lobby \\
Mouth full \\
Blood capsules

I strolled into the lobby \\
Mouth full \\
Blood capsules

I'm off the juice for seven months \\
I learn to like living clean \\
But there just isn't any money \\
On the independent scene

Not even if you're cutting corners \\
Staying in nights, eating alone \\
Somebody's gotta pay the gas bill \\
It's not gonna go away on its own

I strolled into the lobby \\
Mouth full \\
Blood capsules

I strolled into the lobby \\
Mouth full \\
Blood capsules

I'm the biggest guy in the bank line \\
Everybody else looks tiny \\
I could almost smell the fear \\
On the lunch-hour car salesman behind me

I know this isn't gonna work \\
I guess I'll see it when I see it \\
I can't work any other jobs \\
This was my last and best idea

I strolled into the lobby \\
Mouth full \\
Blood capsules

I strolled into the lobby \\
Mouth full \\
Blood capsules
