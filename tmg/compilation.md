## Beat the Devil ## {#beat}

Hauling peanut butter crank through Arizona \\
Gotta keep the glowstick babies fat and happy \\
Cactus standing taller than Goliath \\
All the vultures come directly at me

We stash it in between some bales of lumber \\
On flatbeds coming in from Colorado \\
I don't know what you're doing back in Memphis \\
All winter you've been incommunicado

Take a picture \\
Do it fast \\
For the good times \\
For the good times \\
That won't last

Hot sun peels the paint down to the primer \\
Overheating engine spits and whines \\
Try to keep our minds on what we're doing \\
Try to keep the wheels between the lines

The feeling when the cop car flips its lights on \\
The near-electric tension crackling here inside the truck \\
The lack of any word from you in Memphis \\
The sound of someone running out of luck

Take a picture \\
Do it fast \\
For the good times \\
For the good times \\
That won't last

## Brave ## {#brave}

*"Chris Knox, this is John Darnielle, out here in North Carolina, sending you
all the power, any reserves of power I might have that'll help you up the
hill. But I know you can go there, because I used to watch you every night in
1995 while we were in the back of a van together, and think, 'That guy's got
some power.' So I know you have it, and I know you will climb up on your two
magnificent feet."*

Color me red \\
Color me coal \\
Wrap me in black \\
Or a snide acid green

Tell me I'm bad \\
Tell me I'm sick \\
Scream out your hate \\
Be obsessed and obscene

Bind me with love \\
Tie me with wire \\
Wrap me in gauze \\
And then watch as I bleed

Poison your kiss \\
Kill my desire \\
Deliver me pain \\
And ignore all my needs

I will not change \\
I will not alter

Staple my eyes \\
Thrill to my shins \\
Gag me with lead \\
And tear out all my nails

Razor my tongue \\
Sew up my mouth \\
Feed me disease \\
So my functioning fails

I will not change \\
I will not alter \\
For I am man \\
And I am strong

Do all this to me \\
I just don't care \\
Blood is my wine \\
And fear is my friend

But please do not say \\
I am not hard \\
Don't say I can yield \\
Don't say I can bend

I will not change \\
I will not alter \\
For I am man \\
And I am strong

I cannot sway \\
I cannot falter \\
I must be man \\
I can't be wrong

It's your fucking fault \\
You and your doubts \\
Made me like this \\
Color me man \\
Color me man

## Daniel ## {#danielcover}

Daniel is travelling tonight on a plane \\
I can see the red taillights heading for Spain \\
Oh, and I can see Daniel waving goodbye \\
God, it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes

They say Spain is pretty but I've never been \\
Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen \\
Oh, and he should know, he's been there enough \\
Lord, I miss Daniel, oh I miss him so much

Oh, Daniel, my brother, you are older than me \\
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal \\
Your eyes have died but you see more than I \\
Daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky

Daniel is travelling tonight on a plane \\
I can see the red taillights heading for Spain \\
Oh, and I can see Daniel waving goodbye \\
God, it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes

Oh God, it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes \\
Oh God, it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes \\
Oh God, it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes

## Drug Life ## {#drug}

Hey, where's my pills \\
They were sitting on the windowsill \\
Should have known something was wrong \\
When last week you took my favorite bong \\
Now it's gone

You're messing with my drug life \\
Quit messing with my drug life

Dimebags flash up the Union Square \\
People walk in serotonin pairs \\
I remember it was only play \\
Devils sucking up the protégés

Just shuffle off through the golden mist \\
Take a number, 'cause you're on my list \\
And later on Second Avenue \\
If it comes down to the drugs or you \\
Baby we're through

You're messing with my drug life \\
Yeah \\
Yeah, quit messing with my drug life \\
Na na na na

## Elsa from Rialto ## {#elsa}

*(no lyrics)*

## Etruscans ## {#etruscans}

*"One, two, three, and."*

Sift through \\
The things we had that seemed worth fighting for \\
Dig through the embers

Seek out \\
Awitness to the times we used to share \\
Weed out the pretenders

Go and find \\
You an Etruscan

Reveal the hidden truth \\
About the serpent's tooth \\
Try not to get romantic

Tell tales \\
About white whales \\
Way out in the Atlantic

Go and find \\
You an Etruscan

Seek out his dwelling place \\
Describe his face \\
For the record

Seek out the feral child \\
Head out into the wild \\
Send word when you get there

I'll wait here day and night \\
Hoping you'll be all right \\
Sadly knowing better

Go and find \\
You an Etruscan \\
Go and find \\
You an Etruscan

## François Mitterrand ## {#francois}

*"... is a song that my friend Joel wrote when --- \\
I wrote the music though."*

François Mitterrand, do you have the heater on \\
François Mitterrand, do you have the heater on \\
François Mitterrand, do you have the heater on \\
François Mitterrand, do you have the heater on

Keep it up \\
Keep it up \\
Keep it up \\
Keep it up

He's in France, he's a country in France \\
He's a god and oh, can he dance \\
He has sex when the lights are down low \\
There's one thing that I just gotta know

François Mitterrand, do you have the heater on \\
François Mitterrand, do you have the heater on

Shows love for the people he rules \\
He knows French, diplomatically cool \\
He has sex every hour of the day \\
There's one thing that I really wanna say \\
Go

François Mitterrand, do you have the heater on \\
François Mitterrand, do you have the heater on

## From the Lake Trials ## {#trials}

*"One, two. One, two, three, and."*

Remind ourselves each day \\
What we crawled up from and who we are \\
Clean myself like a cat \\
Who spent too long beneath a car

Everything goes still \\
Between the present moment and the dawn \\
All God's creatures freeze up \\
When you flip the high beams on

Long live the machines \\
Long live the machines \\
Long live these blissful carcasses \\
With their bones picked clean

Bad dreams, bad dreams \\
With a panoramic view \\
Make a list of things to beat the dreams back \\
Follow through, follow through

Swim to shore, scramble up \\
Maybe make it through the clearing to the road \\
All God's creatures hold their breath if they have to \\
Until their lungs explode

Long live the machines \\
That never learned to work quite right \\
Long live the permanent ongoing blink \\
Of the engine light \\
Of the engine light

## Get Your Mom Some Pie for Hanukah ## {#hanukah}

Won't you give your mom some pie for Hanukah \\
Your mom would like some pie \\
With a nice sugar crust and some cheese on the side \\
Please don't let another Hanukah go by \\
Without giving your mom a slice of pie

Is this the gratitude your mom gets \\
You come around here with your little shiksa wife \\
But you can't be bothered to bring a pie with you \\
Once in your life

Won't you put away your Tortoise remix records \\
Get out your Steve and Eydie box set \\
Bring a lovely slice of pie down to mom's house right now \\
And have the best Hanukah yet

Won't you give your mom some pie for Hanukah \\
Your mom would like some pie \\
With a nice sugar crust and some cheese on the side \\
Don't let another Hanukah go by \\
Without bringing your mom some pie

Hava nagila \\
Hava nagila \\
Hava nagila \\
Hava nagila \\
Hava nagila \\
Hava nagila \\
Hava \\
Yeah

## Little Boxes ## {#boxes}

Little boxes on the hillside \\
Little boxes made of ticky-tacky \\
Little boxes, little boxes \\
Little boxes all the same

There's a green one and a pink one \\
And a blue one and a yellow one \\
And they're all made out of ticky-tacky \\
And they all look just the same

And the people in the houses \\
All went to the university \\
Where they got put in boxes \\
And they came out all the same

And there's doctors and there's lawyers \\
And business executives \\
And they're all made out of ticky-tacky \\
And they all look just the same

And they all play on the golf course \\
And drink their martinis dry \\
And they all have pretty children \\
And the children go to school

And the children go to summer camp \\
And then to the university \\
Where they get put in boxes \\
And they come out all the same

And the boys go into business \\
And marry and raise a family \\
In boxes made of ticky-tacky \\
And they all look just the same

There's a green one and a pink one \\
And a blue one and a yellow one \\
And they're all made out of ticky-tacky \\
And they all look just the same

And they're all made out of ticky-tacky \\
And they all look just the same \\
Yup

## Pet Politics ## {#pet}

Guard my bed \\
While the rain turns the ditches to mirrors \\
By a vase of carnations from central Ohio \\
Where the looking machine can't hear us

Deep in the night we dream of positions \\
There's a line for the phone in the hall \\
And in the cold places where Spanish is spoken \\
Most wars end in the fall

You never know when your pet will go \\
Pet politics

Still wearing last night's mascara \\
Now that her pet was gone for sure \\
She was shivering so hard \\
It looked like there were two of her

I could see through the sleeve on her blouse \\
The mute plans of her architect lover \\
A tattoo of a boarded-up house \\
An ink door that belonged to another

When the rain hits you it hits you slow \\
Stitch after stitch \\
Stitch after stitch

Adam was not the first man \\
Though the Bible tells us so \\
There was one created before him \\
Whose name we do not know

He also lived in the garden \\
But he had no mouth or eyes \\
One day Adam came to kill him \\
And he died beneath these skies

I find it so amazing how \\
I go where I'm led \\
I go where I'm led \\
I go where I'm led \\
I go where I'm led

I suspect we could be losing now \\
Please guard my bed \\
Please guard my bed

## The Pieman ## {#pieman}

*"This is like the oldest Mountain Goats song in existence."*

For days I watched you from my place \\
A thousand miles away in space \\
Remembering your body \\
How it turned me into what I am now \\
I have not broken any laws \\
To work toward my stupid cause

I can see you now \\
From where I am \\
I can see you completely

I planted hedges of hydrangea \\
Because you were going to Pennsylvania \\
And I didn't know what else to do \\
I wanted to put my hands on you \\
I wanted to tell you everything \\
But I ended up here orbiting

I can see you now \\
I can feel you now \\
From where I am \\
I can see you completely

I went into your room \\
It got so crazy in there the air turned hot \\
And I saw them but I didn't read your letters \\
I will never bleed \\
Like I used to bleed again \\
I can't bleed like normal men

But I can see you \\
My heart beats like a magic drum \\
From where I am \\
I can see you completely

*"Thanks."*

## Porcile ## {#porcile}

When I wake up \\
I crawl on all fours to the kitchen \\
And I admire myself \\
In the dish of water on the floor

These summer mornings \\
They can't last forever you know \\
There's gonna come a day, come a day \\
When no one here can stand it anymore

The stench and the overwhelming noise \\
Pull the truck up to the front \\
Drive 'em in boys \\
Drive 'em in boys \\
Drive 'em in

So when I hear them coming \\
I try to stand up, but I fall down \\
I fall down and I smash my nose against the counter as I go \\
Blood splashes on the tiles

And I want to clean it up \\
But there is no time to clean it up, is there \\
Things are bad for us right now \\
Things are gonna be bad for a while

Yeah, the stench and the overwhelming noise \\
Pull the truck up to the door \\
Drive 'em in boys \\
Drive 'em in boys \\
Drive 'em in

## Predator Eyes ## {#predator}

There's terror in Terror City, oh yeah \\
There's terror in Terror City, oh yeah \\
Terror in the face of the animal \\
Oh yeah

The animal who \\
Is looking at you

There's terror in Terror City, oh yeah \\
Terror in Terror City, oh yeah \\
Terror in the face of the animal \\
Oh yeah

The animal who \\
Is looking at you

There's terror in Terror City, oh yeah \\
Terror in Terror City, oh yeah \\
Terror in the face of the animal \\
Oh yeah

The animal who \\
Is looking at you

## Seven Hundred Unspeakable Names ## {#names}

I might sail a junk to China \\
If the wind was right \\
I might hit up old friends for money \\
In the middle of the night \\
I might scale the Chrysler Building \\
In a lizard suit \\
I might take up quilting \\
I might learn to play the flute

But I would not invoke \\
The seven hundred unspeakable names \\
No, I would not invoke \\
Those ancient unspeakable names

I might crash high school reunions \\
At schools I didn't go to \\
I might wear a turquoise toe ring \\
If I could fit my toe through \\
I might make myself some pancakes \\
Or I might make a waffle \\
I might retract my previous couplet \\
'Cause let's be honest, it was awful

But I would not invoke \\
The seven hundred unspeakable names \\
No, I would not invoke \\
Those ancient unspeakable names

I might take on effulgence and shine \\
In the black night sky \\
I might show up in a clown suit \\
And make all the children cry

I might blame others for my wretchedness \\
Or I might look within \\
I might save a lot of money \\
If I cut back on the gin \\
I might seek help for my sickness \\
Or insist that I'm all right \\
Or stow away on some mysterious junk \\
To China in the night

But I would not invoke \\
The seven hundred unspeakable names \\
No, I would not invoke \\
Those ancient unspeakable names \\
No, no, I would not \\
Because I could not

## Shot in the Dark ## {#shot}

Out on the street I'm stalking the night \\
I can hear my heavy breathing \\
Paid for the kill, but it doesn't seem right \\
Something there I can't believe in

Voices are calling from inside my head \\
I can hear them, I can hear them \\
Vanishing memories of things that were said \\
They can't try to hurt me now

But a shot in the dark \\
One step away from you \\
Just a shot in the dark \\
Always creeping up on you \\
All right

Taught by the powers that preach over me \\
I can hear their empty reason \\
I wouldn't listen, I learned how to fight \\
I opened up my mind to treason

But just like the wounded and when it's too late \\
They'll remember, they'll surrender \\
Never a care for the people who hate \\
Underestimate me now

But a shot in the dark \\
One step away from you \\
Just a shot in the dark \\
Always creeping up on you \\
All right

But just like the wounded and when it's too late \\
They'll remember, they'll surrender \\
Never a care for the people who hate \\
Underestimate me now

But a shot in the dark \\
One step away from you \\
Just a shot in the dark \\
Always creeping up on you

Just a shot in the dark

## Un Rêve Plus Long Que la Nuit ## {#reve}

On a Wednesday \\
On the 110 \\
I felt the fever \\
Rise again \\
The weatherman east of here \\
Predicted rain \\
I hammered the words \\
Into my brain \\
That you were all I'd ever needed \\
To get by

On the Long Island Expressway \\
At 4 AM \\
On a Tuesday \\
Humidity like I'd never known before \\
And you sleeping like a baby \\
I could hear the engine roar \\
Somewhere high up above us in the New York sky \\
Where time means less than nothing \\
And no one ever dies \\
Someone knew that you were all \\
There was worth needing

## White Box ## {#box}

I did it now \\
Oh, I did it now \\
The box said \\
Do not open \\
Under pain of death \\
It had my initials there where I \\
Signed my initials on it \\
On that white box

I saw initials there \\
Do not open under \\
Pain of death \\
But I opened it anyway \\
I died anyway \\
I died anyway

So I come back to stay \\
Come back to stay \\
Lord knows I love you anyway \\
Lord knows I love you anyway \\
A-ay

## Wild World ## {#wild}

Hold me up baby, for I may fall \\
Hold my dish rag body tall \\
Our bodies melt together, we are one \\
Post-crucifixion baby, post-crucifixion and all undone

It's a wild world \\
It's a wild world \\
La la la la la, la la la la \\
It's a wild world \\
Hey \\
It's a wild world

Church bells ring out the toll of our night \\
Falling forever forward, forever backward, forever forward, all right \\
Strophe and antistrophe, strophe and antistrophe, hey \\
Antistrophe, come on and kiss me tight

It's a wild world, a wild world \\
Way up here in your arms tonight \\
It's a wild world \\
It's a wild world \\
It's a wild world \\
It's a wild world
