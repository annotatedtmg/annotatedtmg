[^rajajohn]:
    "I had these songs I'd written after seeing Chicago for the first time,
    and experiencing humidity the likes of which we never have back in
    Southern California. I transferred them to quarter-inch reels and sent
    them down to New Zealand. A couple weeks later the phone rings at 4:30 in
    the morning.  It's Alastair Galbraith. He holds the phone up to his
    four-track reel-to-reel and plays me the first of these four songs.
    Hands-down one of the best moments I've ever had, listening to what
    Alastair had done, lying on my bedroom floor in the dark with the phone
    pressed up to me ear. The violin wailed through the earpiece like a
    newborn infant." --- Ghana liner notes

[^raja]:
    A [raja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raja) is a Sanskrit word for a
    monarch, used throughout the Indian subcontinent.

[^galbraith]:
    Orange Raja, Blood Royal is a collaboration EP with [Alastair
    Galbraith](https://alastairgalbraith.bandcamp.com/), who went on to
    collaborate with the Mountain Goats in other endeavors as well. In an
    interview, he described the collaboration as follows:

    > On the 1993 tour of the States, Peter and I played a gig at Pomona just
    > outside of Los Angeles at a venue called The Haven, and our support act
    > for the evening was The Mountain Goats. John Darnielle at that point, as
    > he does now, played acoustic guitar and sang, and that time he had the
    > 'Bright Mountain Choir' backing him up, two women that sat on either side
    > of him in chairs and swayed from side-to-side and sang a bit of back-up
    > harmony. His intensity was awe-inspiring, and he lived the songs as he
    > sang them. His lyrics were so beautiful, and the fact that he was really
    > feeling what he was communicating struck me very powerfully and by the
    > time he had finished I'd written him a kind of fan letter at the table I
    > was sitting at, saying that I had never seen anything like this, and that
    > he was a great songwriter and a brilliant performer and that it was hard
    > to go on after him. Later that evening he and I and Dennis Callacci and
    > Alan Callacci *\[sic\]* sat around at Dennis's house and passed around an
    > acoustic guitar and played each other lots of songs. John wrote to me
    > after I got back to New Zealand and asked if I would be interested in
    > putting violin onto some songs. I ended up thinking I wanted to put more
    > than just violin on, so I ended up using old, fake, third-world-shop tabla
    > and a little bit of mouth organ which I had never played before, and a few
    > violin tracks and sang, or repeated, some of his lines, although he'd
    > asked me not to (laughs). But he ended up liking that.

    John has also commented very positively about the collaboration:

    > John: ... the collaborative thing is when you meet up with somebody and
    > you get along well enough to see what each other are doing that you think,
    > "well, the natural thing to do is to do something together." That's what
    > happened with me and Alastair. And that's ideal.
    >
    > Matt Houser: How did you meet Alastair?
    >
    > J: We played a show together at The Haven near Pomona. I enjoyed what he
    > did and he enjoyed what I did. I mentioned to him before he left the
    > possibility of doing something and he said, sure, send me stuff. And I
    > did.
    >
    > M: And he just added his tracks?
    >
    > J: He wrote me a letter and we really hit it off spectacularly that night.
    > It was amazing. And those songs \[from the Orange Raja, Blood Royal 7"\]
    > were written at a very particular time he knew a lot of details about --
    > that he correctly heard where they were coming from and really hooked into
    > it. He's great.

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

Fools and young men prate about everything being possible for a man. That,
however, is a great error. Spiritually speaking, everything is possible, but
in the world of the finite there is much that is not possible.

--- Søren Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling [^kierkegaard]

Thanks to Dan. The Mountain Goats are John and Rachel. Sure is dark in here.

Credite mihi, amate poenas.

--- Seneca [^seneca]

[^kierkegaard]:
    [Søren Kierkegaard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard)
    was a pivotal 19th century Danish philosopher and widely considered to be
    the first existentialist. His work focused largely on Christian ethics,
    alienation, the subjectivity of meaning, establishing the self, and other
    existential themes. In particular, *Fear and Trembling*, a title drawn
    from the Psalms, discusses the importance of resignation to one's fate as
    a key step in faith, allowing one to truly be hopeful and free. To make
    this point, he draws on the Biblical story of Abraham, who is called on by
    God to sacrifice his only son, Isaac.

    The quoted phrase is derived from a paragraph in which Kierkegaard is
    exploring what he calls the "knight of faith", a person whose faith in God
    and himself allows them freedom of choice. Particularly, he is arguing
    that letting go of attachment to some possibilities allows him a greater
    and more profound spiritual experience.

[^seneca]:
    An incomplete quote from Seneca the Younger's tragedy
    [*Thyestes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyestes), written in the first
    century CE. This play tells the story of Thyestes, who with his brother
    Atreus murder Chrysippus, their half-brother, to secure the throne of
    Olympia. Their father, Pelops, exiles them, and they ultimately become
    rulers of Mycenae, leaving many deaths and betrayals behind them.

    This quote is spoken in the beginning of the play by the Ghost of
    Tantalus, who is speaking with one of the Furies, as he refuses the Fury's
    call to torment other prisoners.
    [Tantalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantalus) is a Greek mythological
    figure famous for his eternal punishment in Tartarus, the prison of the
    Titans, where he is forced to stand in a pool of water underneath an
    abundant fruit tree, but starves and thirsts as the pool and fruit always
    pull away from his reach. More fully, Tantalus' Ghost says (quote
    underlined):

    > Quicumque poenas lege fatorum datas \\
    > pati iuberis, quisquis exeso iaces  \\
    > pavidus sub antro iamque venturi times \\
    > montis ruinam, quisquis avidorum feros \\
    > rictus leonum et dira Furiarum agmina \\
    > implicitus horres, quisquis immissas faces \\
    > semiustus abigis, Tantali vocem excipe  \\
    > properantis ad vos: <span style="text-decoration:underline">credite experto mihi, \\
    > amate poenas.</span> quando continget mihi \\
    > effugere superos?

    Translated, this reads:

    > Whoe'er thou art, by the fates' law bidden to suffer allotted punishment;
    > whoe'er liest quaking beneath the hollowed rock, and fearest the downfall
    > of the mountainous mass even now coming on thee; whoe'er shudderest at the
    > fierce gaping of greedy lions, and, entagled in their toils, dost shudder
    > at the dread ranks of furies; whoe'er, half burned, shunnest their
    > threatening torches, hear ye the words of Tantalus now hasting to you:
    > <span style="text-decoration:underline">believe me who know, and love your
    > punishments.</span> Oh, when shall it fall to me to escape the upper
    > world?

## Blood Royal ## {#royal}

I remembered you \\
I remembered where you'd come from \\
I remembered you \\
I remembered where you'd gone \\
And in the shifting neon air \\
I saw the colors of the revolution everywhere \\
Blood royal

I remembered you \\
I remembered all the little things you said \\
I remembered the shape of your face \\
I let the thought go to my head \\
And in the iron blue dawn \\
I felt power coming on \\
Blood royal

## The Only Thing I Know ## {#only}

When you came back from Trenton [^trenton] \\
All the sparkle was gone \\
You stood in the shadow \\
And the curtains were drawn \\
And I know you're lying \\
And you know you're lying too \\
That is just about \\
The only thing I know about you

When you pocketed your eyeshadow \\
And you picked up the phone \\
Stepped on the balcony \\
And drank in the drone \\
And I know you're leaving \\
You know you're leaving too \\
That is just about \\
The only thing I know about you

When you stopped on the sidewalk \\
And you looked up above you \\
The warm, wet air came down the shelter \\
How much do I love you \\
Well, you know you're dying \\
And I know you're dying too \\
That is just about \\
The only thing I know about you

[^trenton]:
    Trenton is the name of multiple cities, but given the album cover, it most
    likely refers to
    [Trenton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenton,_New_Jersey), the capital
    city of New Jersey, located near New York City and considered to be part
    of the New York metropolitan area.

## Raja Vocative [^vocativejohn] [^raja] [^vocative] ## {#vocative}

A bird you would have liked brought the sky down \\
But it was useless to see it without you around \\
And in the unstoppable camera of my mind's eye \\
I saw you and some foreign guy

And I could hear your voice ringing \\
I could hear you singing \\
From all away across the country in Palm Springs [^palmsprings] \\
I could hear you now

Your laughter tore through the New Jersey night \\
And I can't stand it, but I'm all right \\
Stood out on the balcony and I took a look around \\
And a bird we would have loved the sight of brought the sky down

And I could hear your voice ringing \\
I could hear you singing \\
From all away across the country in Palm Springs \\
I could hear you now

[^vocativejohn]:
    "If you want to know a secret about this song I will tell you one. It is a
    heavily-coded response to some personal pain I was going through when I
    wrote it. There is maybe one person alive who would be able to do the
    decoding necessary to get at the truth of the matter, and she isn't
    talking."

    "This is a song written by a much younger man than me who had the same
    social security number. It's a love song." --- Bottom of the Hill, San

[^vocative]:
    Vocative has two meanings: it is a [type of grammatical
    case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocative_case) found in Latin,
    Sanskrit, classical Greek, and some Slavic languages; it also describes
    something that refers to a vocation or profession. The vocative case is
    used for nouns that address a person.

[^palmsprings]:
    [Palm Springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Springs) is a city
    located in the Coachella Valley of the Southern California desert,

## Hatha Hill [^hatha] ## {#hatha}

As the sun went away \\
It was sending out signals \\
You had sugar on your stomach \\
You had sugar on your hair \\
You had sugar underneath your eyes \\
You had sugar on your mouth \\
I know that trick too \\
I know what it means coming from you

[^hatha]:
    Hatha is a Sanskrit word meaning force or violence. It is commonly
    associated with [hatha yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatha_yoga), a
    set of physical practices originating with Hinduism intended to promote
    spiritual strength. In the 20th century, hatha yoga practices spread in
    the Western world as a form of exercise.

    I'm not aware of any specific location called Hatha Hill, but if you know
    differently, please [let me know](../about.html#contact).
