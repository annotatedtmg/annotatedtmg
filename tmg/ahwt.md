    An interview dedicated entirely to All Hail West Texas and music that John
    enjoyed that was related to it can be found in the SPIN session, August
    13, 2013.

[^reissue]:
    All Hail West Texas was reissued in 2013 by Merge, containing new liner
    notes, remastered tracks, and 6 additional songs ([see](#liner)
    [below](#related)). Announcing the reissue, John said:

    > Getting the reissue together has been a really interesting project for me,
    > because it involves going through old boxes of tapes, which necessarily
    > means exhuming the corpses I became at several turns between then and now.
    > All Hail was the last grinding burst of [the machine on which I'd built
    > whatever name I had at the
    > time](http://www.download-manual.com/shop/prodimages/005300210074.jpg). It
    > was recorded in the final frenzy of the boombox-era writing style (hit a
    > stride, work absolutely every night until you write a song you don't like,
    > sulk for a couple of days, start up again), though I'm hesitant to say
    > final, because who knows, I still track demos on a couple of the working
    > decks I still have and I have ~~~ideas~~~about restricting myself to
    > demo'ing on tape for a season at some point, who knows, life's long,
    > "seldom say never" remains my non-committal motto par excellence. It's the
    > only album where one of the worktapes went missing not by accident (the
    > fate of untold handfuls of worktapes) but because I made good on my
    > generally-empty promise to myself to destroy stuff if I don't want to see
    > it out in the wild at some point. In between the songs that made the
    > album on the two surviving worktapes there's a lucky 7 that didn't make
    > the cut, sometimes for technical reasons ("ran out of tape"), sometimes
    > for artistic ones ("this chorus: what were you thinking?"). These songs
    > have been transferred from the original cassettes and are now on the
    > reissue as bonus tracks, mainly ones that fit into the former category.
    > Several more I didn't transfer from the original cassettes at all, because
    > after listening to them, it was learned that they kind of sucked. RIP,
    > "Red Southern Curl," you are just plain not a good song.
    > 
    > There's more to tell, but most of it's in the new liner notes, and the
    > rest of it's in [this piece Matt Fraction wrote about
    > it](http://johndarnielle.tumblr.com/post/50512256444/notes-on-imaginary-extant-lost-deleted-and),
    > which is legitimately all you really need to know.

*"All Hail West Texas" was recorded in central Iowa using the trusty Panasonic
RX-FT500 [^rxft500] and the occasional Marantz PMD 222. [^pmd222] While there
is seldom much to say about the deliberately primitive nature of the
recordings we make, the strange case of the Panasonic RX-FT500 is worth
considering for a moment or two.  Bought at a Circuit City in Montclair,
California in 1989 or thereabouts, its functioning used to suggest a
combination of two technologies, one brutishly sophisticated and the other
magnificently cheap. Its built-in condenser microphone didn't condense (that
is, it didn't react to changes in volume by automatically contracting its
diaphragm) unless the levels with which it found itself confronted were truly
overwhelming, which never happened; meanwhile, oblivious to this tic of mass
production, the machine's designers hasn't thought to situate the actual
moving parts (that is, the gears) as far as cosmetically possible from this
unusually sensitive microphone. The results were uncannily accurate
representations of sound complemented and complicated by some pretty ferocious
wheel-grind. Sometime around 1998, the Panasonic appeared to have breathed its
last. When you'd punch "Record," a large triangular piece of plastic just to
the left of the spindles would begin jutting in and out of the view frame,
bringing with it a clicking noise whose arrhythmic clatter could in no way be
incorporated into any songs one might be trying to record on such a low-tech
piece of equipment. In the summer of 2000 [^1999] having written a few new
songs that took place in Texas and being frustrated with the uniform sound of
the Marantz, we hauled the Panasonic out of its corner and gave it a shot,
just in case it might have repaired itself during the long time it had spent
standing all alone near the window.*

*The results are what you have with you now: the sound of a long-broken
machine deciding, on its own and without the interference of repairmen or
excessive prayer vigils, to function again. It is a painfully raw sound that
can legitimately be thought of as a second performer on these otherwise
unaccompanied recordings. Its inexplicable self-originating will to go on
echoes some of the boneheaded ideas that motivate the people who populate
these little songs. Some of us, when we're really sleepy or facing an
unacceptable loss, imagine the hand of a person behind all this: an ornery
little fellow who will have no sound without a second sound to obscure and
pollute it, who is deeply mistrusting of singers in general, and who believes
that whatever "signal-to-noise ratio" might mean, it can't be any good unless
more value is placed on the latter of the two hyphenated terms. Of course the
original signal is never actually anywhere near any recordings anywhere, but
you all already knew that. You have been sure of it for quite some time now.
You see the proof everywhere. It is the reason you started reading these lines
in the first place.*

Our love of west Texas and its rich musical heritage in no way mitigates the
universally held maxim that you shouldn't have a hockey team in a place where
no one will ever under any circumstances be able to play hockey outdoors...
Special thanks to young men and women in bedrooms with electric guitars and

TO TAKE THIS ANY MORE.

This is an album called *All Hail West Texas*, which I wrote when I lived in
Ames, Iowa. It's the first of the three albums I wrote in the small house we'd
moved to from Colo after the City of Colo bought out the owners of the even
smaller one we'd been renting and told us we had to leave so they could knock
it down.

It's also, as its original liner notes make much of, the last album that the
Panasonic RX-FT500 had in it. All our previous full-lengths --- the ones that
got issued on CD, anyway --- had been mixtures of home-recorded songs and
takes from radio shows and ventures into Bob Durkee's studio; all were, to
larger or lesser extents, collaborative, featuring other musicians and
singers. *All Hail* is really the only one that fits the "one guy recording
alone in his house" description.

As it happens, the album exists partly because I ended up spending a fair bit
of time alone in the house. My wife, Lalitree, was playing hockey with a squad
at ISU, [^isu] and she heard something about a women's hockey camp in Banff;
[^banff] it was a week-long deal in summer, and she decided to go. I'd just
changed jobs, and I was going through orientation. Orientation, if you've
already been through it in several health-care jobs, involves getting a bunch
of mimeographed handouts which the management is legally required to read to
you as you read along. There's at least five eight-hour days of this, and
sometimes it goes on for two whole weeks. You can get a lot of lyric-writing
done in the margins of these handouts. [^orientation]

Around three o'clock each afternoon, orientation would let out, and I'd go
home to a mainly empty house. ("Mainly" here because I mean no disrespect to
the cats, and because I am so poor at housekeeping that no house with me in it
can fairly be called "empty.") I didn't own a laptop and I'm pretty sure we
were still tethered to the wall at 64kbps, so hanging out online all day was
even less rewarding than it is now. Some people would have taken this
opportunity to hang out with friends, but... like... have you ever seen a
possum on a summer night? How he just comes shuffling out of nowhere all by
himself, all beady-eyed and content and solitary, heading through the dark to
who knows where? I am essentially a possum.

So I'd watch baseball or old horror movies on cable and go through my notes,
and I'd mute the TV when I found something I wanted to work on, which had been
my songwriting pattern since 1991. I would revise the verses I'd written down
on the orientation materials, and set them to music, and record them.
Sometimes I'd run down to Hy-Vee [^hyvee] for provisions, and listen to my
recent efforts on the way there.

It was a pretty productive summer, I see from the surviving tapes. "Absolute
Lithops Effect" appears to have been the first song written; "Distant
Stations" came directly after, followed by three songs I didn't like well
enough to release or work on any further. Then "Pink and Blue". That was it
for keepers on the a-side of the first tape; the b-side fared better: "Fall of
the Star High School Running Back" and "Color in Your Cheeks" were written in
the same night, and "Source Decay" and "The Mess Inside" crop up a few tracks
further down. By the time Lalitree got home I'd written "The Best Ever Death
Metal Band in Denton" and "Jenny" and a couple of others. The unused ones that
still seem interesting to me are here as bonus tracks; there was once a third
tape of the stuff I kept writing after I felt like I had enough for the album,
but I threw a tempter tantrum one day years later and pitched it into the
garbage, which I'd almost regret doing, except that the idea of lost and
unrecoverable work has this dumb romantic appeal to me, so when I think of
that tape off in oblivion somewhere, rotting away, I get the sort of
moony-eyed stupid look on my face that is the exclusive domain of dumb
romantics.

The tapes were originally transferred from cassette to 1/4" reels by Alex
Newport at Tiny Telephone within a few months of their having been recorded,
and that's good from the archivist's standpoint, as it turns out. Initially,
we retransferred from the cassettes for this release, but in listening, we
found that time had had its way with them: much of the high-end was missing,
gone, unavailable. It had once existed in the form of magnetic particles on
the original cassettes, and those cassettes had shed enough of those particles
in the intervening years that the remnant was like a mildly eroded version of
the originals. So we brought up the 1/4" reels. God bless Ampex. [^ampex] The
reels had guarded their particles jealously, and the minute "The Best Ever
Death Metal Band in Denton" rang out, we knew they were perfect. Naturally,
there's also more dumb romantic appeal for me in the degradation of original
sources. I can't help it.

I don't remember when the album came out, or how it did, or whether it met
with favorable reviews. By the time it got released I was pretty heavily into
that job I'd been going through orientation for. it involved working with
children in a residential setting: rich, rewarding work. I do remember
bringing my first copy into work one day and playing in on the house boombox
after the children had gone off to school. I watched the door closely and kept
my hand near the player so my supervisor wouldn't come in just in time to hear
her morning shift guy singing "hail, Satan" through the speakers, and I had
few plans for the future except to keep working at all the things I liked
working at. I didn't know, at the time, that this would be the last album I'd
make where all the takes were live within minutes of having written the songs,
and I don't really know that now, either: it's a long life and lots of things
happen. The house in Colo was razed to the ground and the last time I saw the
spot it was only a giant hole in the earth. All hail. All hail. All hail.

--- *Durham, North Carolina, 2013*

Thanks to Craig Stewart for originally releasing this album and for always
believing in me: without your faith and goodness this record wouldn't exist,
and neither would any of the other ones that came after it. Craig originally
sent our the promos with pages from a very old Texas road atlas enclosed; only
one person ever noticed or said anything about it. To the best of my knowledge
none of these promos have ever been spotted in the wild, making them the most
elusive piece of Mountain Goats ephemera known... Thanks, finally, from the
deepest and truest depths of my heart, to Jeff and Cyrus: for making
yourselves known to me, for raising your voices, and for refusing to go down
without a fight.

*This reissue is dedicated to Matt Fraction, because we are both still here,
and who would've guessed it.*

NOTES ON TRACKS 15 -- 21: [^reissuevariations]

These were mastered from the surviving cassettes, which, again, have degraded
over time. Insert your own high end by humming the root chord; if you can get
a friend to do the fifth, so much the better.

*(reissue back):*

It is clear that if one has a substantial collection of molecular groups, then
it is quite a difficult matter for any other creature to pass through the
groups, but a so-called "ghost" which has its molecules widely spaced can
easily pass through a brick wall. \\
--- T. Lobsang Rampa, *You Forever* [^rampa]

*(reissue CD/vinyl label):*

Special thanks to the young men and women with electric guitars and Hate
Eternal [^hateeternal] t-shirts who have shaped our now-radiant future. All
hail! All hail! All hail!

## The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton [^deathmetaljohn] [^deathmetalseries] [^denton] ## {#deathmetal}

The best ever death metal band out of Denton \\
Was a couple of guys who'd been friends since grade school \\
One was named Cyrus, and the other was Jeff \\
And they practiced twice a week in Jeff's bedroom

The best ever death metal band out of Denton \\
Never settled on a name \\
But the top three contenders, after weeks of debate \\
Were Satan's Fingers, and the Killers, and the Hospital Bombers [^bandnames]

Jeff and Cyrus believed in their hearts they were headed \\
For stage lights and Learjets, [^learjet] and fortune and fame \\
So in script that made prominent use of a pentagram [^pentagram] \\
They stenciled their drum heads and guitars with their names

And this was how Cyrus got sent to the school [^utah] \\
Where they told him he'd never be famous \\
And this was why Jeff in the letters he'd write to his friend \\
Helped develop a plan to get even

When you punish a person for dreaming his dream \\
Don't expect him to thank or forgive you \\
The best ever death metal band out of Denton \\
Will in time both outpace and outlive you

Hail Satan [^singit] \\
Hail Satan tonight \\
Hail Satan \\
Hail, hail [^hail]

[^deathmetaljohn]:
    One of the major show-closing encore songs and one of the Mountain Goats'
    most popular tracks.

    "This is a song about hope in your life. There is a magnificent Mark
    Eitzel song title, It Is Important Throughout Life to Proclaim Your Joy.
    It's also important to admit on occasion to the righteousness of your fury
    and the justness of your cause in the face of those who would do you
    wrong, and who would rob you of your youth, and who would ignore what's
    good and beautiful in you. And I know this is all corny platitude stuff,
    but I know people who got sent to places, and it sucked for them, you
    can't even say how bad it was. Kirk FitzPatrick, I remember when they sent
    you away, man, this is for you." --- Swedish-American Hall, San Francisco,
    February 25, 2009. See also Judge John Hodgman, Episode 98: All Dogs Go to
    Trial, Sketchfest, San Francisco, February 20, 2013.

    "One of the earliest sources for inspiration for that song was a friend of
    mine who was dating another friend of mine, and he was going through the
    experience of being seventeen and being exposed to new ideas and coming
    into yourself as you do when you're a teenager, it's an incredible, magic
    time, there's nothing like it, you know --- being exposed to literature and music
    and going, 'I am someone other than these people who made me'. Amazing,
    right. But he was Mormon, and his Mormon family was not down with where he
    was going, you know, and like a lot of Mormon families in the '80s they
    thought, 'How can we fix this?' So one day, his girlfriend called me, and
    said, 'They took him away.' And I said, 'So where --- what are you even
    talking about?' 'He's in Provo.' Provo, Utah. We were in Southern
    California.  That's the Moon, you know. He was gone, and he couldn't get
    out until he was 18. Now, he happens to have turned out great, he's a
    professor of philosophy, you know, but I thought how many people must have
    had their hopes crushed by these people who are trying actually to restore
    their version of hope to them." --- City Arts and Lectures, Herbst
    Theatre, San Francisco, February 24, 2009

    He further clarifies at City Arts and Lectures that while he's inspired by
    his Mormon friend, Jeff and Cyrus aren't intended to be Mormon, and he
    wants people to be able to project their story on them.

    There is a wonderful dedication to this song sung at Berbati's Pan,
    Portland, October 3, 2003, but since it's not relevant to understanding
    the song, you'll have to go listen to it yourself.

[^hail]:
    The "Hail Satan" lines were ad-libbed at time of recording.

    "\[It\] didn't feel quite done. I never wrote 'Hail Satan' on the paper I
    was writing it on, it just seemed like there was something more to say.
    And I'm playing it and I'm like, 'How do I feel right now? *Hail Satan* is
    how I feel right now.' ... I can tell you what that means in that song.
    That means, all the things you tell young people they have to feel?  Fuck
    you. All those things that you tell young people that they have to be, you
    know.  All the ways in which you try to make up for your own failure
    through the people whose dreams you should be guarding and cherishing. Go
    die with those. Satan can eat you." --- City Arts and Lectures, Herbst
    Theatre, San Francisco, February 24, 2009. See also SPIN session, August

    "I hold with the Gnostics who say that there are two Satans, and one can't
    help you, and he's bad and is the cause of illness and disease and pain.
    And the other is he who resists, and he who stands against those that
    would hold you back, from the pain that would keep you from advancing, and
    that is who we will now worship." --- Zoop II, Farm Sanctuary, New York,

A way to make real money \\

[^runningback]:
    [Running back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back) is a backfield
    position in American football whose major function is to accept handoffs
    of the football from the quarterback and then run, or rush, the ball to
    gain yardage. They also block and receive passes. They can be either
    halfbacks or tailbacks, who are the primary runners, or fullbacks, who
    generally block for the halfback or tailback.

[^rush]:
    To [rush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(American_football)) the ball
    in American football means to gain yards by running with the ball, as
    opposed to passing. 8 and 1/3 yards per carry is a tremendous statistic,
    only two professional football players have ever beat that statistic in a
    season in the entire history of the National Football League, Michael Vick
    in 2006 and Beattie Feathers in 1934.

[^poppa]:
    This line is taken directly from the third verse of [The Notorious

    Sometimes John introduces this in a bleaker fashion, but I generally think
    this an actual love song; he has referred to it as "jubilant". I Only

We get our chocolates from Belgium \\
We have our strawberries flown in from England

But none of the money we spend \\

I got a cracked engine block, both of us do [^engineblock]

Yeah, the house, and the jewels, and the Italian race car \\
They don't make us feel better about who we are \\
I got termites in the framework, so do you

Down here where the watermelon grows so sweet \\
Where I worship the ground underneath of your feet \\
We are experts in the art of frivolous spending

And it's gone on like this for three years I guess \\
And we're drunk all the time and our lives are a mess \\
And the deathless love we swore to protect with our bodies is stumbling across its bleak ending

But none of the rage in our eyes \\
Seems to finish it off where it lies \\

    Many urban legends exist stating that putting sugar in the fuel of a car

We live high, our love gorges \\
On the alcohol we feed it \\

We hold on as hard as we can \\
Our knuckles are white

We write letters to each other \\
Invent secrets to confess to \\
I learn foreign and exotic \\
Terms of endearment by which to address you \\
We feed fresh fruit to one another \\
We stay up all night

And I am healthy, I am whole \\
But I have poor impulse control \\
And I want to go home \\
But I am home

We are strong and we are faithful \\
We are guardians of a rare thing \\
We pay close, careful attention \\
To the news the morning air brings \\
We show great loyalty \\
To the hard times we've been through

We are filled with riches and wonders \\
Our love keeps the things it finds \\
And we dance like drunken sailors \\
Lost at sea, out of our minds \\
You find shelter somewhere in me \\
I find great comfort in you

And I keep you safe from harm \\
You hold me in your arms \\
And I want to go home \\
But I am home

But you cannot run \\
And you cannot hide \\
From the wreck we've made of our house \\
And from the mess inside

We went down to New Orleans [^neworleans] \\
One weekend in the spring \\
Looked hard for what we'd lost \\
It was painful to admit it, but we couldn't find a thing

I wanted you \\
To love me like you used to do

We went to New York City in September \\
Took the train out of Manhattan to the Grand Army stop [^grandarmy] \\
Found that bench we'd sat together on a thousand years ago \\
When I'd felt such love for you I thought my heart was gonna pop

I wanted you \\
To love me like you used to do

But I cannot run \\
And I can't hide \\
From the wreck we've made of our house \\
And from the mess inside

    it.' And maybe you look it up in a dictionary, but there's just a picture
    of your motel under that. And you think, 'That's really fucked up.' It's
    like a movie, and you start looking around for cameras --- there's no
    cameras." --- Bowery Ballroom, New York, March 28, 2011

## Distant Stations [^stationsjohn] ## {#stations}

I found an old rock \\
In the dry dirt outside \\
The door of my motel room \\
It was a triangle with soft rounded edges \\
And a split down the middle of one corner \\
It was darker than English moss \\
Green like the soft frills of a peacock's plume

I waited for you \\
But I never told you where I was \\
It was you who taught me how \\
To write these kinds of equations \\
I waited on the steps for you \\
And I hid in the bushes whenever a car pulled into the parking lot \\
You taught me how to listen to these distant stations \\
Distant stations

I saw the sky break \\
I threw a rock at a crow who was playing in the mulch of some rose bushes by the motel office \\
Missed him by a good yard or two \\
I sang old songs from nowhere \\
Los Angeles, Albuquerque [^albuquerque] \\
Said a small prayer for the poor and the naked and the hungry \\
And I prayed real hard for you

I waited for you \\
But I never told you where I was \\
It was you who taught me how \\
To write this kinds of equation \\
I waited on the steps for you \\
And I hid in the bushes whenever I saw a car pull into the parking lot \\
You taught me how to listen to these distant stations \\

[^stationsjohn]:
    "The song is like a study of inaction, right, of a guy who --- if you
    write indie songs, usually your early narrators are, they think being a
    stalker is a romantic thing to do. You find this, that all young indie
    songwriters, myself included, is, they think, 'What is a more romantic
    figure to cut than a guy who is obsessed with some girl and is stalking
    her?' Hopefully, though not always, you grow out of that. But you still
    are interested in these guys who are tormented by these feelings that they
    have. So, my stalkers don't do jack, that's their new thing, they sort of
    just think about it and maybe, you know, walk past a building whose name
    is the same as the state where his intended lives." --- Zoop, Farm

## Source Decay [^sourceseries] [^sourcejenny] ## {#source}

One a week, I make the drive two hours east \\
To check the Austin [^austin] post office box \\
And I take the detour through our old neighborhood \\
See all the Chevy Impalas [^impala] in their front yards up on blocks \\
And I park in an alley and I read through the postcards \\
You continue to send \\
Where as indirectly as you can, you ask what I remember \\
I like these torture devices from my old best friend \\
Well, I'll tell you what I know \\
Like I swore I always would \\
I don't think it's gonna do you any good \\
I remember the train headed south out of Bangkok [^bangkok] \\
Down toward the water

I always get a late start \\
When the sun's going down \\
And the traffic's thinning out \\
And the glare is hard to take \\
I wish the west Texas highway [^highway] was a Möbius strip [^mobius] \\
I could ride it out forever when I feel my heart break \\
I almost swear I hear it happen \\
It's that clear and that hard \\
I come in off the highway \\
And I park in my front yard \\
I fall out of the car \\
Like a hostage from a plane \\
Think of you a while \\
Start wishing it would rain \\
And I remember the train headed south out of Bangkok \\
Down toward the water

I come into the house \\
Put on a pot of coffee \\
Walk the floors a little while \\
I set your postcard on the table \\
With all the others like it \\
I start sorting through the pile \\
I check the pictures and the postmarks and the captions and the stamps \\
For signs of any pattern at all \\
When I come up empty-handed the feeling almost overwhelms me \\
I let a few of my defenses fall \\
And I smile a bitter smile \\
It's not a pretty thing to see \\
I think about a railroad platform back in 1983 \\
And I remember the train headed south out of Bangkok \\
Down, down toward the water

    major annual folk festival. There's no documentary evidence linking this
    particular town to the song, but it's the only significant town I'm aware
    of that meets the criteria specified in the opening lines of the song. To
    drive to Austin from Kerrville, you would take State Highway 16 to US 290
    East.  Thank you to Texan Andy Jones for pointing this out to me!

    When tracing the loop, one finds that despite being two-dimensional, it
    only has a boundary in one dimension, and in fact has only one side.

## Absolute Lithops Effect [^lithopsjohn] [^lithops] ## {#lithops}

After one long season of waiting \\
After one long season of wanting \\
I am breaking open \\
My insides, pink and raw \\
And it hurts me when I move my jaw \\
But I am taking tiny steps forward \\
And I, I feel sure that my wounds will heal \\
And I, I will bloom here in my room \\
With a little water \\
And a little bit of sunlight \\
And a little bit of tender mercy \\
Tender mercy

The big trucks come up the highway \\
And the big wheels rattle my windows \\
And night, night comes to Texas \\
After one blind season alone in here \\
After one long sweltering summer \\
I, I'm going to find the exit \\
And I will go to the house of a friend I know \\
And I will let myself forget \\
With a little water \\
And a little bit of sunlight \\
And a little bit of tender mercy \\
Tender mercy

## Indonesia [^indonesiajohn] [^indonesiaseries] [^indonesia] ## {#indonesia}

The summer came in carrying spring in its mouth \\
Held it up for everyone to see \\
This is the time when all our plans and schemes \\
Melt down into listless anarchy \\
Historically, anyway, that's been the case \\
But this year there's a new pink sheen on your face \\
Like the color of a secret flower \\
That grows tall and moist and incorruptible [^rafflesia] \\
Indonesia \\
Indonesia

The season tunneled forward like a moth through grain \\
Its hunger was an all-consuming mindless thing \\
And you slept for twelve to fourteen hours at a stretch \\
I wondered what the weather in the fall was gonna bring \\
And then you said you dreamt of cowboys that were zombies in disguise \\
Well, I knew fall was never coming, it was written on your eyes \\
Like the mist that hangs there in the air \\
On the mountainside where rare and nameless flowers grow \\
In Indonesia \\
Indonesia

[^indonesiajohn]:
    "I've thought of this song a lot over the years, because I remember
    working on it pretty hard: not over a long period of time, but over the
    course of one of those really focused evenings where you turn around and
    you've spent several hours trying to get all the angles just right. I can
    hear the seeds of the somewhat more expansive writing style I'd shoot for
    on *Tallahassee* here: the little riff, the development, a little more
    elbow grease on the rhymes. But it has nothing to do with the several
    stories that intersect throughout the album; it's just a freestanding
    song, and it didn't belong, so it got put in the corner, and it stayed
    there. Not recorded on the Panasonic but into the Marantz PMD-222, a
    professional cassette recorder mainly used for reporting. *Is there an
    actual flower that grows tall and moist and incorruptible in Indonesia*:
    yes, and its name is 'Rafflesia,' which in the happily-lost initial draft
    rhymed with 'Indonesia.' Its nickname is 'corpse flower,' which could
    conceivably have been rhymed with 'horsepower' if I hadn't settled on a
    different solution." --- All Hail West Texas [reissue liner

## Midland [^midlandjohn] [^midlandseries] [^midland] ## {#midland}

Come and stay with me as long as you like \\
I live outside of town where the straight highway curves \\
For three years I lived next door to the airport \\
So nothing you can say to me can get on my nerves \\
Stay 'til you feel your legs underneath you again \\
I've got room in my house for you

I got a Kenmore single room window unit air conditioner [^kenmore] \\
Cools down the place in the full heat of day \\
And a family of possums have made their home underneath the front steps \\
They are majestic in their own beady-eyed homey way \\
Stay until you can breathe like normal people do \\
I've got room in my house for you

They tore down the airport in 1981 \\
This is where I came when I ran out of places to run

Come, come, come and stay with me out here away from things \\
Come and stay with me where the sky's real clear \\
I live way out where no one believes anybody could live \\
Sky's purple from six in the evening 'til midnight out here \\
Stay 'til the world goes down in flames \\
I've got room, room in my house for you

    first line of the second verse is dumb. 'But John,' you might say, 'you
    could have worked on it a little more; the song might have been salvaged
    thereby.' But in those days a song got exactly one day in which to either
    resolve its issues or be cast forth from the company of its brethren. It

    "There's one of the bonus tracks, is one where it has this line about an
    air conditioner, that when I first heard it, I was like, 'Oh, that is a
    terrible line, don't, no, that's not any good', you know... It's just the
    identification of the Kenmore. To me, that's a relic of a different style
    of lyric writing that I'd been doing like two years previously where I was
    kind of more interested in little specific physical details, and I sort of
    can hear myself realizing as I deliver that line that I have outgrown that
    style, you know, and it's like, and I sort of hear my, my enthusiasm lags.
    But I think the song sort of, it resolves nicely from there. You sort of
    have a freedom if you're not worried about anyone ever hearing it, where
    you can let things go to a different and almost more interesting place
    than the place where you're trying to knock everybody over." --- NPR

Before the wind blew everything away \\
Where we came to get away from our friends \\
Where we tell each other jokes waiting for the world to end \\
We know our jokes are funny \\
But in all the wrong ways \\
And we rent old George Romero movies [^romero] \\
Relish the short time left \\
Waiting for the dead \\
To rise up from their graves \\
Waiting for Jesus \\
To come along and save us \\
Yes, and biding our time \\
Biding our time \\
Biding our time as best we know how

    "This was also the last song on a side, as you'll hear, and I did try
    tracking it again at the beginning of the other side, because I was fond
    of the song. But I didn't like the next take as much as I'd liked this
    one, and that was the end of that. If the song didn't like the rules, it
    ought to have sought out a less temperamental songwriter. *Should George
    Romero be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom*: yes." --- All Hail
    West Texas [reissue liner notes](#fn:reissuevariations)

    A number of themes seem to play on each other here: a juxtaposition of the
    dead rising for the Last Judgment and the dead rising to attack the living
    in Night of the Living Dead; similarly, the title of Waco and the
    reference to doughboys seems to allude to the assault on the Branch
    Davidian compound by federal law enforcement to the experience of being
    trapped in a farmhouse assaulted by zombies in Night of the Living Dead.
