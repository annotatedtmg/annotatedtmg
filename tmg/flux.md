## Daniel 12:8 (third) ## {#daniel}

Walk in the darkness, bump into things all night \\
Get dizzy and angry searching for some source of light \\
Unknown alphabets in spray paint on the street \\
Seek out their source and find it and fall down at his feet

Get some aspirin powders to rub into my gums \\
Wait for the pain to hit me, buckle when it comes \\
Feel it drill in like a corkscrew \\
Avert my eyes when the cause comes into view

Feel the fear in my chest all day \\
Praise you anyway

Feel the fear in my chest all day \\
Praise you anyway

See the road rise to the summit up ahead \\
Remember an old friend with a pistol to his head \\
When it comes my time for the laying on of hands \\
Let me feel the blow when it lands

Look for the secrets half-buried like trinkets in a field \\
Hope that the hidden things someday will be revealed \\
Stumble through the darkness, can't see anything at all \\
Whimper like a whipped dog when I fall

Feel the fear in my chest all day \\
Praise you anyway

Feel the fear in my chest all day \\
Praise you anyway

## Matthew 11:14 -- 19 ## {#matthew11}

*"This is Matthew 11:14 -- 19, alternate version. Two, three, four."*

He who casts the stone can't ever do so on his own \\
It takes a crowd to drown a witch \\
Or so he said to us when he'd wriggled free and got the gun from me \\
Standing before us, his cracking voice rising in pitch

And then the blood that's been spilling from his eyes \\
Soaks through the bandages that are wrapped around his face \\
And just before he walks backwards through the wall \\
He pivots forty-five degrees to face us all \\
And he says, let him who has eyes to see \\
Take a good look at me \\
I'm a Mylar sheet hanging in the sun

Claude Rains in all his glory \\
Is not arrayed like these \\
Who have come to walk before us \\
Rising from their knees

Fighting back against their captors \\
Calling down the curse \\
Like this man whose substance is malleable \\
Screaming out chapter and verse

And then the blood that's been spilling from his eyes \\
Soaks through the bandages that are wrapped around his face \\
And just before he walks backwards through the wall \\
He pivots forty-five degrees to face us all \\
And he says, let him who has eyes to see \\
Take a good look at me \\
I'm a Mylar sheet hanging in the sun
