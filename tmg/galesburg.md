[^galesburgjohn]:
    John describes that the couple whom he's singing about in Full Force
    Galesburg is different from those in Sweden and in other series, "a little
    angrier and a little less easy to sympathize with". The songs are at least
    loosely connected. VPRO session, February 17, 2000; [KJHK
    interview](http://www.themountaingoats.net/misc/kjhk.html), March 2, 1997,
    transcribed by Jon Nall, retrieved July 16, 2014.

    Full Force Galesburg was written mostly in an off-campus apartment in
    Grinnell, Iowa, presumably while Lalitree was still a student there. Zoop,
    Farm Sanctuary, New York, June 17, 2007.

    The cover image depicts [Durga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga), a
    fierce version of Parvati, riding her tiger mount. Beneath her, two other
    Hindu deities, [Hanuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman) and
    [Krishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna), are dancing.

[^vanmorrison]:
    The title *Full Force Galesburg* alludes strongly to the Van Morrison song
    [Full Force Gale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Force_Gale), released
    in 1979 on his album *Into the Music*. The song uses the metaphor of being
    lifted upwards by a gale to describe a religious feeling of finding
    solace, hope, and rebirth in his faith in God.

    Thanks to Johnp from the forums for pointing this reference out to me!

[^galesburg]:
    As alluded to in [Weekend in Western Illinois](#weekend),
    [Galesburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galesburg,_Illinois) is a city in
    Western Illinois and the county seat of Knox County. John has confirmed
    that he's referring to the Illinois Galesburg. [KJHK

*(poster):*

BECAUSE WE'RE YOUNG WE THINK NOTHING CAN HURT US \\
SOMETHING CAN

16 songs about people whose good intentions are having exactly the outcome you
might have predicted if you weren't such a damned optimist.

*(booklet):*

I am a straightforward man, with no crime on my conscience, \\
But I was accused of being a spy for China. \\
So life, you see, is never very smooth business, \\
And now the present bristles with difficulties.

--- Ho Chi Minh, Poems from Prison Diary, [^minh] Hanoi: Foreign Languages
Publishing House, 1959.
{: .in}

Small red potatoes in the rich black soil. Green young trees sucking up the
river water. Oranges from Spain. Rain-chute running down the side of the
trailer. Islands. Paper mills all the way out in Roaring Spring, Pennsylvania.
New banjo from Nashville. Calendar from De Smet and Van Diest [^smet] showing
April on the wall, all wrong. Heading North through France for days but never
getting out. Old barn, strange sounds. Gin. Sunlight. Almost broke my own
heart down there in Vicksburg. [^vicksburg] There is always an anchor
somewhere. All that was left later was the vision of the two of us crossing
the parking lot toward the blazing room off the interstate half an hour past
Iowa over on the other side of the Mississippi. These songs are about what
made that moment either possible or inevitable, depending on how you look at
it.

IF THERE IS ONE THING I LOVE it's the weather this year: how it swings
suddenly the wrong way just long enough to confuse the geese, who figure, what
with the way the air's warmed up on a given day, that winter's over. North
they go, and I hear them from where I am. They sing happily, flying in a
looser formation than you'd think evolution would allow. They're headed home.

A FEW DAYS LATER, OF COURSE, the elements remember what they're about, and the
clouds come closer to the earth than they should, and the fog hangs heavy on
the ground, and I hear the sound again and look up: here they come again,
flying much lower now and calling to one another for fear that one of them
will get lost in their hasty retreat southward. It is now the middle of
winter.

SOON IT WILL BE COLD ENOUGH to keep them south until the Spring thaw. It will
be so cold that we will almost forget them. We will imagine that we have been
this cold throughout our entire lives. We haven't. One find day they will soar
through the skies above our small town again, heading North, and the full sun
will be bright behind them. The humid air will stick to us like a death in the
family. The geese will sing with a joy that even our dreams never approach.

WE MAY FREEZE, BUT WE WILL NEVER GO NUMB. In the summer we tend to forget
this, and if an unexpected cold front frosts the crops we fear for our lives.
We need not worry. The real danger lies, as we should have learned by now,
elsewhere. There is a burning that not even a midwestern winter can kill.

*(back):*

Probably there are among those of you still reading a few who think the notes
are a bit heavy-handed this time around, and you'd be right if it weren't for
my hold-card: the original notes were a militant vegetarian rant which, among
other things, described the lives of meat-eaters as "meaningless." From these
notes I wish only to salvage their original impetus, which was the desire to
thank the people who drove down from Canada to see me at the Satyricon in
Portland [^satyricon] at the end of a long and exhausting tour. They were all
vegetarians, see, and they lifted my spirits. This bit here is even longer
than the original over-pious monologue which it replaces, but hey, at least it
doesn't tell you carnivores that you're all going to Hell.

Will I ever tire of thanking Lalitree for her love and inspiration? Will I
ever repay the debt I owe to Peter Hughes? Will the Parkinson family please
stand up and take the bow they have coming to them? Will Paul Lukas [^lukas]
admit he's surprised when the Mets make the playoffs this year? Will Jaime
Tugwell [^tugwell] get the "Sir" before his name which he so richly deserves?
Will Sam Deese [^deese] be recognized as the man who has elevated degrading
humor to an art form more complex and ultimately more important than
post-modernism? The answer is probably "no" all all counts [^sic]. This is the
long way around saying that the above-named people are very dear to me indeed,
and that I thank them for not beating me up. Or, in the case of Peter Hughes,
for not beating me up more often.

FULL FORCE GALESBURG was recorded in Iowa, California and New Zealand in 1996
and 1997. Alastair GALBRAITH lent his timeless heart to "Evening in
Stalingrad" and "Original Air-Blue Gown"; Peter HUGHES and Bob DURKEE got all
liquored up and saved "Weekend in Western Illinois" and "Down Here" from a
fiery doom. Bob also recorded the ones that lack wheel-grind and played
bricoleur to the whole thing during a week when he would have had every right
to just crawl into bed and refuse to come out 'til everybody agreed to leave
him along. Thanks for all your help, Bob. It means a lot to me. I hate having
to do this: All songs written by John Darnielle, © and ℗ 1997 Cadmean Dawn

16 new songs. Spring and Summer 1997. Hi, Joel. [^joel]

[^minh]:
    [Hồ Chí Minh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh) was a Vietnamese
    revolutionary communist leader who successfully led the Việt Minh
    independence movement against France and Japan in the 1940s, and later
    opposed the United States as the leader of the Democratic Republic of
    Vietnam in the Vietnam War through the 1960s until his death in 1969. In
    1942, he was arrested in China on charges of being a spy. *Prison Diary*
    is a collection of the poems he wrote during his fourteen-month
    imprisonment.

    Unfortunately, I was unable to find the edition that John used here.
    However, an astute reader found another which reveals this to be the third
    stanza of a poem reprinted in full below with the title  *Hard is the Road
    of Life* (p. 135):

    > Having climbed over steep mountains and high peaks, \\
    > How should I expect on the plains to meet greater danger? \\
    > In the mountains, I met the tiger and came out unscathed, \\
    > On the plains, I encountered men, and was thrown into prison.
    >
    > I was a representative of Viet-Nam \\
    > On my way to China to meet an important personage. \\
    > On the quiet road a sudden storm broke loose, \\
    > And I was thrust into jail as an honored guest.
    >
    > I am a straightfoward man, with no crime on my conscience, \\
    > But I was accused of being a spy for China. \\
    > So life, you see, is never a very smooth business, \\
    > And now the present bristles with difficulties.

    The poem is somewhat unusual in being so long; most poems in the book are
    four lines exactly, with some exceptions other than this.

    Writings, 1920--66*. Bernard B. Fall, editor. New York: Signet.

    by [Total](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A.), a major
    international petroleum company.

[^vicksburg]:
    Vicksburg is the name of several American cities. Given the context here,
    my best guess is that this refers to [Vicksburg,
    Mississippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi), a
    large city located on the banks of the Mississippi River.

[^satyricon]:
    Named after the famous work of Roman fiction, the
    [Satyricon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyricon_(nightclub)) was a
    well-known alternative music nightclub in the Old Town district of
    Portland until its close in 2003.

[^lukas]:

    which the Mets finished as third in the National League East, failing
    ultimately to secure a postseason spot.

## New Britain [^newbritainjohn] [^newbritainseries] [^newbritain]  ## {#britain}

You've had it up to here with my West Country [^westcountry] talk \\
You can hardly understand a word I say \\
Shortest tree around here is a hundred feet tall \\
It's gonna rain today

I try and tell you secrets 'til my face turns blue \\
I am not getting through to you \\
All away across the ocean they're gathering their strength again \\
Lining up along the country's length again

This morning I know who you are \\
This morning I know who you are

On the river, the sun is bright gold \\
And the things you try to say to me make my blood run cold \\
But I hold you anyway \\
And we stare into the sun all day

And you're about to leave again, I've learned to read your movements \\
And I'm learning how to read your mind \\
The sun climbs the sky for us above the Mississippi [^mississippi] \\
And I feel you in my arms but you're hardly even with me

This morning I know who you are \\
This morning I know who you are

[^newbritainjohn]:
    A music video for New Britain was made by some fans shortly after the
    release of Full Force Galesburg. Excited, John supported them, but John's
    casual dislike of the haircut of the lead hurt the feelings of the
    filmmakers and the film was never released. Webster Hall, New York,
    November 9, 2008.

[^newbritain]:
    A reference to the album [*New
    Britain*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Britain_(album)) by the
    English band
    [Whitehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehouse_(band)), released in
    1982\. Like their other albums, this set the stage for industrial music to
    come.

    Other allusions in this title include the following. [New
    Britain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Britain) is an island in Papua
    New Guinea. However, given the West Country line (see [footnote
    below](#fn:westcountry)) and other references throughout the album to
    southwestern England, it seems more likely that this is set in England and
    refers primarily to a newness related to or new incarnation of [Great
    Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain), the island in
    northwestern Europe belonging to the United Kingdom which contains
    England, Scotland, and Wales.

    New Britain is also the name of a melody which was eventually attached to
    the now-famous folk hymn [Amazing
    Grace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Grace) in 1835, the tune to
    which it is still sung today. New Britain itself was an amalgam of two
    melodies originally published in 1829 by Charles Spilman and Benjamin
    Shaw.

[^newbritainseries]:
    New Britain is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^westcountry]:
    The [West Country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country) is a rural
    region in southwestern England encompassing Cornwall at the southwestern
    end and continuing east through Devon and Somerset to Gloucestershire,
    Wiltshire, and Dorset. The dialect is influenced by the native speech of
    Cornish, a Celtic language, and has been stigmatized by the association
    with rural farming and simplicity. This region is referenced both in [New
    Britain](#newbritain) and [West Country Dream](#westcountry).

## Snow Owl [^owlseries] [^snowowl] ## {#owl}

You came down from heaven to the branch outside my window \\
Your feathers were the color of snow \\
The dice were loaded against us ever seeing each other \\
But one of us had nowhere else to go

In your eyes were all the colors that the rainbow forgot \\
Your wingspan was three feet wide or better \\
With your voice practicing notes from time's own beginning \\
You took apart the alphabet letter by letter

And here \\
Where it all stops for good \\
Where the cool waters run \\
Thought I saw a mouse kicking in your beak \\
It was only a skeleton

[^owlseries]:
    Snow Owl is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^snowowl]:
    The [snowy owl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_owl), *Bubo
    scandiacus*, is a species of large owls living in the Arctic tundra
    regions, whether in North America or Eurasia. Wingspans of adults range
    from four to five feet. Occasionally snowy owls come as far south as the
    lower 48 American states or southern Russia, but these sightings are rare.
    Like other owls, snowy owls are carnivores.

## West Country Dream [^westcountryjohn] [^westcountryseries] [^westcountrylive] [^westcountry] ## {#westcountry}

Sure as a surgeon \\
You slipped your hand into the doorjam \\
Blood coursing through the air tonight \\
I know who I am

And I know who you are \\
Or who you were just an hour ago \\
Static interference on the radio tonight \\
I know what I know

Quick as lightning \\
You brought your hand back inside \\
And you shut the door behind you \\
It's too hot out there tonight

Breath rising and falling \\
Expansion, contraction \\
Why'd you tell me this \\
Were you looking for my reaction

[^westcountryjohn]:
    "So, you are in love, you've been in love for what seems like the entirety
    of your real life, and what preceded it --- it either didn't count or it
    happened to somebody else, and so --- so, you're in love, but then, what
    happens, 'cause it's my song, it also all goes to hell. And so, what's
    left is a lot of fear. A godawful amount of fear." --- Empty Bottle,
    Chicago, December 6, 1997. See also Cow Haus, Tallahassee, February 6,
    1998.

## Masher ## {#masher}

Most of the brine has got to boil away \\
Most of the air has got to choke it \\
Most of June I spent in jail again \\
I don't mean jail exactly

Up in the pine tree \\
Red squirrel looking down at me

I am losing control of the language again \\
I am losing control of the language again

Most of the things I used to hold on to \\
Most of the things I used to say to you \\
Most of the ways I knew around the local roads \\
Are disappearing daily

High in the cottonwood \\
You were looking down at me and you sure looked good \\
Hair hanging down in the leaves \\
Neck tilted back to make a rainbow

I was losing control of the language again \\
I was losing control of the language again

## Chinese House Flowers ## {#house}

Wax paper that I taped over the windows \\
Melted quick as chocolate in the heat \\
It'll probably never come off now \\
The windows look like frosted glass if you see them from the street

And the dim light that filters through \\
Cast a new light on you \\
It makes me get all misty because I remember something \\
And then I see your shadow

And I \\
I want to follow you all the way down this time \\
I want to see what it is you're going down for \\
I, I want you more than I want anything \\
I want you the way you were

You were lying in the moonlight \\
Outside in the grass \\
When I heard an animal voice somewhere in the dark \\
And I saw a wing shadow pass

And just then the gleam in your eye \\
Made my blood freeze \\
There was something up above us \\
Rustling in the branches of the trees

And I \\
I pressed up against you again \\
I could hear your heartbeat steady and hard and pure \\
I used to love you so much that I was sure it would kill me \\
And I want you the way you were

## Ontario [^ontario] ## {#ontario}

I know what my weaknesses are \\
Probably better than you do \\
Revolutionary Chinese propaganda \\
The color of blue

I thought I knew what my weaknesses were anyway \\
And then the orange tree blossomed last Saturday [^white] \\
There was nothing in it but pain for me

I know what can hurt me real bad \\
And what can't hurt me anymore \\
I know how to rise up with the sun \\
And I am learning what sleep's good for

I thought I'd figured out the world and its circular way \\
And then I saw the sun fall down out of the sky the other day \\
There was nothing in it but pain for me

Squirrels climbing trees in bloom \\
Soft yellow light spilling into the room \\
My favorite records \\
My favorite books \\
The people I love \\
The people I almost love

Light beckoning \\
Wind whistling \\
Hey, hey \\
Hey, hey \\
Day breaking \\
River rolling [^sun] \\
Hey, hey \\

[^venus]:
    [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus), the second planet from the
    sun, has a harsh atmosphere comprised almost entirely of carbon dioxide
    but containing clouds of sulfur dioxide, the combination of which leads to
    sulfuric acid droplets. As the ensuing severe greenhouse effect leads to
    an average surface temperature of over 460 °C, these droplets do indeed
    evaporate before landing, called virga.

    Krasnopolsky VA, Parshev VA (1981). [Chemical composition of the

[^crane]:
    The [red-crowned or Japanese
    crane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-crowned_crane), or *Grus
    japonensis*, is a large endangered crane species native to Siberia, China,
    and parts of Japan, mythologized as a sign of luck.

[^nallalt]:
    Nall initially transcribed this lyric as "japanese red clowns train by the
    water here" in an absolutely fantastic mishear of the lyric. Although he's
    corrected it, it [remains on his
    site](http://www.themountaingoats.net/lyrics/galesburg_lyr.html#down) as
    an alternate lyric. It's been reported to me that subsequent to Nall's
    transcription, John has played this song and sung it with this lyric,
    however, I've never heard a recording of such. If you have, please [get in
    touch](../about.html#contact).

[^lithuania]:
    [Lithuania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania) is a northern European
    country located on the Baltic Sea. A Baltic state, it gained independence
    from the Soviet Union after World War I.

[^johnson]:
    This stanza uses an old, often-used snowclone that found its way into
    gravestones, folk songs, literature, and prayers, that fits the form:

    > X is my name \\
    > Y is my station \\
    > Heaven is my resting place \\
    > God is my salvation

    with X taking the writer's name, Y their home, and with *station*
    occasionally being replaced with *nation* and *salvation* with
    *expectation*, among other modifications. Members of the Mudcat forums,
    associated with the Digital Tradition Folk Song Database, were able to
    [collect many examples](http://www.mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=74217)
    of this formulation, some dating to 1799.

    The specific example of Johnson Johnson used here seems to originate with
    the folk song *The Two Brothers* or *The Twa Brothers*, one of the ballads
    collected by [Francis James
    Child](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_James_Child) (as Child Ballad
    49). While many versions lack this final stanza, some later versions add
    it in. See for example Brave Boys: New England Traditions in Folk Music,
    released by New World Records, which includes such a recording made in
    1964\. The song itself depicts the murder of a boy by his brother.

## Twin Human Highway Flares [^twinhumanjohn] [^twinhumanseries] ## {#twinhuman}

You turned to me and asked me if I'd always be your boy \\
As we drove across the river into western Illinois [^mississippi] \\
And on the railroad bridge, half a mile of solid steel \\
Wheels were spinning out sparks, scraping at the rails \\
Wind in your hair all right \\
Sunset spilling through the rear window \\
Your white t-shirt hugging your shoulders, beaded with sweat

On the day that I become so forgetful \\
That all of this melts away \\
I will burn all the calendars that counted the years down to \\
Such a worthless day

As we walked across the parking lot toward the motel office \\
We were walking with a benediction on us \\
Light was everywhere, the building stood against the sky \\
Like a monument to desperation two floors high \\
Mile and a half from the river \\
We went back to the car to get our overnight bags \\
Sunset spilling through your earrings all over your body

When we shut the motel room door behind us \\
We knew we'd hit the mother lode \\
On the day that I forget you \\
I hope my heart explodes

[^twinhumanjohn]:
    "There are two people in this song --- or three, if you count the highway,
    which I generally do. They look a lot like me and the woman who would
    later become my wife, driving from Chicago to northern Iowa on a summer
    day. Only I don't think that ever happened. I know we never had any '50s
    road movie conversations like the one that opens the song. We weren't, at
    the point in time when this song would have had to've taken place for it
    to be true, using overnight bags. We had suitcases. And there wasn't
    enough backstory between us for buildings to appear as 'monument\[s\] of
    desperation.'

    "But the picture I get in my head, or got in my head when I was writing it
    in a Grinnell apartment circa 1996, was of my girlfriend and I heading a
    little ways west and digging in for a long life together. I think it's
    almost a symbolic scene for me in that way. On one tour we opened the set
    with it quite a few times, and I enjoyed it more and more each night. The

    More than the other songs, Twin Human Highway Flares seems to represent
    the explanation of the album given in the [liner notes](#liner), "All that
    was left later was the vision of the two of us crossing the parking lot
    toward the blazing room off the interstate half an hour past Iowa over on
    the other side of the Mississippi. These songs are about what made that
    moment either possible or inevitable, depending on how you look at it."

## Weekend in Western Illinois [^weekendjohn] [^illinois] ## {#weekend}

The land's opening up like a blanket \\
And the dandelions spread themselves thickly out \\
Along the fields which are evidently endless

And we are hotly in love with one another \\
We've got an unquenchable thirst in our throats \\
We are for some reason all the time bleeding \\
And we are friendless

And we love these dogs \\
That roll on the lawns here in Galesburg [^galesburg] \\
Because they seem to know something nobody else knows \\
It is written in the smiles on their faces \\
And it rings in their high, young voices \\
We are burning up all of our choices up here where the tall grass grows [^corn] \\
Up here in Galesburg

The sky's opening up like an old wound \\
And the rain on our bodies is warm tonight \\
And the ground underneath us shakes in the cracking thunder

We can taste fresh blood in our mouths again \\
There is no chance of getting enough of it \\
And we tally up all up all our possessions \\
We're going under

Yeah, we love these dogs \\
That lull in the rain here in Galesburg \\
As the new season rocks them in its terrible arms \\
Yeah, they howl as though the world were ending \\
As we are watching the sky unwinding \\
And some of our promises were binding up here where our dreams take form \\
Up here in Galesburg \\
Up here in Galesburg

## US Mill ## {#usmill}

Way up north \\
Down the road a little \\
Back in New England \\
Right here in the middle

And all the way out west \\
We had our ears to the ground \\
All of our dreams resting in the same spot \\
Listening for the old sound

And it was ringing as clear as crystal \\
And it was shining as bright as gold \\
Grain gathering on the stone floor \\
And we were spring-heeled and we were real cold

All summer long \\
Deep into autumn \\
In a high room \\
And down here in the bottom \\
Down here in the bottom

## Song for the Julian Calendar [^calendarseries] [^calendar] ## {#calendar}

Sun twinkling on the river this eve \\
I tasted chocolate on my tongue \\
Darkness climbing up the ladders to the sky \\
Rung by agonizing rung

I heard firecrackers popping next door \\
Wondered what it was I'd bargained for \\
When I laid quiet on the floor \\
And you were knocking

Let me be your witness \\
Let me walk out on the edge \\
Sun refused to shine on my backyard today [^trouble] \\
Darkness climbing up the house coming through the window ledge

I saw the firecrackers bursting on the sidewalk \\
Heard you talking your baby talk \\
Saw the bright lights again and I felt the shock \\
When you were knocking

[^calendarseries]:
    Song for the Julian Calendar is part of the [Song for ...
    series](series.html#songfor).

[^calendar]:
    The [Julian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar) was a
    Roman calendar introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BCE and lasting until the
    introduction of the currently-used Gregorian calendar in 1582, which
    changed the accounting of leap years to more accurately reflect astronomic
    reality. Prior to the Julian calendar, Romans used a 12-month calendar of
    355 days, with a intercalary month of 27 days occasionally inserted
    between February and March to correct the calendar, and often manipulated
    for political ends; the Julian calendar ended this practice and had
    timekeeping rely solely on the sun. Some churches continue to use the
    Julian calendar today for their religious ceremonies.

[^trouble]:
    This is very similar to the closing line of the chorus (sometimes, the
    opening verse) to the eight-bar blues standard [*Trouble in
    Mind*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trouble_in_Mind_(song)), originally
    recorded by singer Thelma La Vizzo with writer Richard M. Jones on piano
    in 1924:

    > Trouble in mind, I'm blue \\
    > But I won't be blue always \\
    > 'Cause I know the sun's gonna shine \\
    > In my back door someday

    The song has been recorded in various forms by dozens of artists over the
    years, including Nina Simone, Dinah Washington, Aretha Franklin, Lightnin'
    Hopkins, Hank Williams Jr., and many others.

    Thank you to Evan Perez for noticing this!

## Maize Stalk Drinking Blood [^maize] ## {#maize}

Lying in the hot sun today \\
Watching the clouds run away \\
Thought a little while about you \\
The sky was a petrifying blue

And while the geese flew past for no reason at all \\
I let the sky fall \\
This is an empty country and I am the king \\
And I should not be allowed to touch anything

I picked myself up off the ground \\
Shook the grass from my hair and I walked around \\
Felt the warm sun in my eye \\
Strangers were passing by

I shinnied [^shinny] up the black walnut tree [^walnut] \\
Let the hard blue sky fall right through me \\
And I saw the sad young cardinals trying to sing \\
And I should not be allowed to touch anything

[^maize]:
    This is a confusing title. While I freely admit to being unsure of its
    meaning, my best guess is that it refers to an Mayan religious practice
    surrounding sacrifices. In these, a maize stalk would be placed on a
    [stela](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_stelae), upon which the priest
    would drip blood. This practice could, however, be unrelated entirely to
    this song and be only a coincidence.

[^shinny]:
    John has confirmed that this is actually "shinnied", meaning to climb a
    tree, rather than "shimmied", as Nall reports.

[^walnut]:
    Black walnut, or [*Juglans

## Evening in Stalingrad [^stalingrad] ## {#stalingrad}

When you were nineteen I first laid eyes on you \\
The small stream that ran through the center of town carried your name to me \\
Your hair was dark and your eyes were a frosty blue \\
And then they put me in jail 'til you were 23

When you were 24 we took to drinking and dancing \\
We boxed with our shadows like a couple of kangaroos \\
And then we went down to Chechnya [^chechnya] for the weekend \\
Your eyes were glacial and your promises all rang true

And things are happening here while we sleep \\
I can feel it in my boiling brain \\
And I'm dreaming in blood-red color \\
When I see the Stolypin car [^stolypin] riding through the light rain

They'll have to carry me out on my back \\
They'll have to tear me to pieces all right \\
We are warm in our hidden room down here \\
We've got stars in our eyes tonight

[^stalingrad]:
    Named Stalingrad after Joseph Stalin in 1925, eventually being renamed to
    its current name of [Volgograd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volgograd)
    in 1961 as part of Khrushchev's de-Stalinization programs, this is a large
    city in Volgograd Oblast, western Russia. Originally, the city was named
    Tsaritsyn.

[^chechnya]:
    [Chechnya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya) is a republic in
    southwestern Russia, which fought for independence after the breakup of
    the Soviet Union in 1991 and was eventually crushed by Russia in 1999.
    Depending on the year in which this song takes place, Chechnya could be
    independent (1917 -- 1921 and 1991 -- 1999), part of the Soviet Union
    (1921 -- 1991), or part of Russia (after 1999), making such a vacation
    either extremely dangerous or indicative of some political or military
    relationship, or a simple trip south with no such overtones.

[^stolypin]:
    A [stolypin car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolypin_car) is a type of
    Russian railroad carriage designed to transport people and livestock to
    implement the Stolypin agricultural reforms in the 1900s. Such reforms
    aimed to eliminate collective agriculture and force a capitalist schema of
    farming. The cars were later used for passenger transportation and then by
    Soviet security forces for prisoners.

## Minnesota [^minnesotajohn] [^minnesota] ## {#minnesota}

Seeds came in the mail today from Holland [^holland] \\
And the language on the package is wonderful and strange \\
All sorts of flowers that grow up from the earth \\
In goodly colors gloriously arranged [^amoretti] \\
I circled the house and I scattered them around \\
Let the water sink down into the soil \\
Stared a long time at the residue \\
Blood, milk, and oil \\
God, the humidity is something \\
Our shirts are soaked clean through \\
But the house is throbbing and the heat keeps coming \\
And I keep looking at you

And then you're singing in Dutch to me \\
And I recognize the song \\
And it seems so old and so fragile \\
And I haven't heard it in so long \\
We may throw the windows open later \\
But we are not as far west as you suppose we are \\
Hot wind coming off the water \\
Sky gone crazy with stars [^stars] \\
While we stay here, we imagine we're alive \\
We see shadows on the walls \\
There's something waiting for us in the hot, wet air [^smell] \\
Sweat, water, and alcohol \\
Just the old blood \\
Rising up through the wooden floor again \\
Just the old love \\
Asking for more again

    "It's a song about that point in the relationship, you've all been there,
    where you've been drunk for weeks, and you look across the table at the

## Original Air-Blue Gown [^thevoice] ## {#original}

Rain all burned away \\
The horseflies are an iridescent green \\
Plums boiled down to pulp \\
Drying on a screen

Bright red air inside the house here \\
I can barely draw breath \\
Dark blue shapes pop behind my eyelids \\
I am not afraid of death

And on the television \\
Black and white footage of the young Cassius Clay [^clay] \\
My God, my God, my God \\
He was something

Fists flashing as he comes toward the screen \\
Sailing headlong into nothing \\
And disappearing \\
Reappearing \\
Out there in the clearing \\
Floating down a slight breeze \\
That plays along the edges of the leaves \\
It's you \\
It's you \\
It's you

[^thevoice]:
    This title comes from the [Thomas
    Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy) poem *The Voice*,
    written after the death of his estranged wife in 1912:

    > Woman much missed, how you call to me, call to me, \\
    > Saying that now you are not as you were \\
    > When you had changed from the one who was all to me, \\
    > But as at first, when our day was fair.
    > 
    > Can it be you that I hear? Let me view you, then, \\
    > Standing as when I drew near to the town \\
    > Where you would wait for me: yes, as I knew you then, \\
    > Even to the original air-blue gown!
    > 
    > Or is it only the breeze, in its listlessness \\
    > Travelling across the wet mead to me here, \\
    > You being ever consigned to existlessness, \\
    > Heard no more again far or near?
    > 
    > Thus I; faltering forward, \\
    > Leaves around me falling, \\
    > Wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward \\
    > And the woman calling.

[^clay]:
    Cassius Clay was the birth name of [Muhammad
    Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali), the famous heavyweight
    boxing champion. Ali changed his name after winning the heavyweight title
    from Sonny Liston in [a 1964
    upset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_vs._Sonny_Liston); the
    use of Clay instead of Ali in this song implies a fight of Ali's prior to
    his name change, perhaps this famous fight (also alluded to in [Love Love
    Love](sunset.html#love)).

## It's All Here in Brownsville [^brownsvillejohn] [^brownsville] ## {#brownsville}

*"One, two."*

Meanwhile out where nothing starts \\
Out where the railyard ends \\
The sun up above us is trying to kill himself \\
We were watching the skies again

Why do we come down to Brownsville \\
Year after year after year \\
This was the question we never even posed \\
Ringing like a siren in our ears

Down on the Mexican border \\
In the unfathomable heat \\
With our shirts tied around our waists \\
And the world at our feet

We looked at one another's bodies \\
Figured we looked all right \\
Ready to die if we had to \\
Watching the skies all night

And I was sure my heart would break \\
When the sun sank down into California \\
I felt your breath on my neck, it was hot and good and pure \\
And I wanted to warn you

It's all coming apart again \\
It's all coming apart again \\
It's all coming apart again \\
It's all coming apart again

[^brownsville]:
    Many American cities and districts are named Brownsville. However, given
    the reference to the Mexican border, I belive this refers to [Brownsville,
    Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville,_Texas), a large city at
    the southernmost tip of Texas, directly across the border from Matamoros.
