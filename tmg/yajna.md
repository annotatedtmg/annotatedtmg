## Palmcorder Yajna ## {#yajna}

Palmcorder Yajna is annotated with [We Shall All Be
Healed](wsabh.html#yajna).

## Butter Teeth [^teethjohn] [^teethseries] ## {#teeth}

We spilled out through the front door \\
Into the blinding late light \\
Sun reflected on the storefront windows \\
Tremendously bright

We were Norwegians come down from the north \\
Attacking the walls of the fortress \\
I was permanently at the point of exhaustion \\
You were gorgeous

Who's here \\
Just us \\
Nobody else around \\
Stray electrical currents \\
Trying to find the ground

We haunted the halls of the pharmacy \\
Artlessly shoplifting random things \\
Painkillers, cough syrup, Tiger Balm [^tigerbalm] \\
Bubblegum, cigarettes, and shower curtain rings

We were Portuguese warships cresting the waves \\
Cannons raised, ready to dock \\
You were counting down the hours and the minutes \\
I was trying to find a way of stopping the clock

Who's here \\
Just us \\
Nobody else around \\
Stray electrical currents \\
Trying to find the ground

## Snakeheads [^snakeheadsseries] [^snakehead] ## {#snakeheads}

Weather cell [^cell] from northern Canada \\
Due in before the afternoon is over \\
Brown cows in the fields \\
Eating their way slowly through the clover

And the canopy of apple trees before us \\
Symmetrical and pure as a pagoda [^pagoda] \\
Me and Li Chong from Chicago in a U-Haul [^uhaul] \\
Headed out through Western Minnesota

Headed for the islands \\
Headed for the islands

Our load is heavy, you can hear it shifting \\
Say what you like, I'm never gonna stop \\
Everyone will eat when we've arrived \\
White apple blossoms soften up the blacktop

Two days from now we'll get to where we were going \\
The western sky will pitch-correct its whining \\
Our cargo's gonna spill out from the cabin \\
And rub its eyes and see the silver lining \\
Yeah, yeah

Headed for the islands \\
Headed for the islands

    A [snakehead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakehead_(gang)) is a term for
    a Chinese people smuggler. This is not the same as trafficking, similarly
    to a Mexican coyotaje, snakeheads are paid by the people they smuggle, who
    are trying to leave China and escape into wealthier, safer places.

    air that moves and behaves cohesively, being the smallest unit of a storm

    function, found throughout multiple Asian cultures.

    [U-Haul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Haul) is a moving vehicle rental

    I don't know that Li Chong is referencing a specific person rather than a
    general name; if you know more about this, please [let me
    know](../about.html#contact).
