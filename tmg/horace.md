[^horacejohn]:
    "Written and recorded over the course of one week and released as-is. I
    think it accomplished what it set out to do: its characters are
    sufficiently desperate, their ends transparently sordid. In retrospect, I
    probably should have just dubbed a copy of Spandau Ballet's album *True*
    and tried to pass it off as my own work, but the idea didn't occur to me
    until it was too late." --- Bitter Melon Farm liner notes

[^cover]:
    Transmissions to Horace had multiple different covers. The cover depicted
    here is that owned by Caliclimber ([see below](#credits)), but many others
    exist. From looking at the versions available, it appears that magazine
    photos of random mountains were cut out and pasted to the J-card, then the
    title written on.

[^horace]:
    [Horace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace) was a famous Roman poet
    living in the first century BCE. He wrote a number of works, mostly
    collections of poems (including his *Satires*, *Odes*, *Epodes*, and
    *Epistles*) and an influential work on how to write poetry, *Ars Poetica*.

TRANSMISSIONS TO HORACE was recorded 12/7/92 & seq. by the Mountain Goats in
California and is:

1\. Going to Cleveland 2. Early Spring 3. Historiography 4. No, I Can't. 5.
Alpha Desperation March 6. Going to Monaco 7. Star Dusting 8. Teenage World

HEUS FORTUNA HEUS FORTUNA HEU [^heu]

Oh, my God, thank you: Peter, the Ketchup Bear, E. F. Apuleit, LetÃ© as always,
Frankling, Ro Rae Amy Saraaa, and Aztec culinary inventiveness.

HEU FORTUNA QUID IN NOS CRUDELIOR [^heu]

AND SLANDERED BY THIS TEUCER, IF YOU PLEASE! [^teucer] \\
heu fortuna heu fortuna heu fortuna heu fortuna heu [^heu]

[^heu]:
    These lines are various modifications on a quote from Horace's
    [Satires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satires_(Horace)), Book II, Poem
    8, *Avarum inepte prodigum salse describit* (*A smart description of a
    miser ridiculously acting the extravagant*), lines 61 -- 63:

    > ... "heu, Fortuna, quis est crudelior in nos \\
    > te Deus? ut semper gaudes inludere rebus \\
    > humanis!"

    Translated, these lines read, "'Alas! O fortune, what god is more cruel to
    us than thou? How dost thou always take pleasure in sporting with human
    affairs!'" In context, the quote is uttered by a glutton, Nomentanus, at a
    feast, startled by a falling tapestry. Fundanius, narrating, and some
    other guests in attendance mock the speaker for being so dramatic about
    something so trivial.

    Horace (1836). [*The Works of
    Horace*](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0893.phi004.perseus-lat1:2.8).
    Christopher Smart, translator. Philadelphia: Joseph Whetham. Perseus
    Digital Library, retrieved July 17, 2014.

[^teucer]:
    [Teucer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teucer) was a tremendous archer who
    fought in the Trojan War alongside his famous half-brother, Ajax. Born to
    the king of Salamis Island, Teucer would eventually found the city of
    Salamis on Cyprus. Here, John is quoting the Sophocles tragedy
    [*Ajax*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(Sophocles)), in which
    Agamemnon rages at Teucer:

    > Ah! That contest for Achilles' armor! \\
    > We shall regret the day we published it \\
    > if every moment we must be defamed \\
    > and slandered by this Teucer, since he won't \\
    > accept defeat or yield to the majority, \\
    > the verdict of the judges.

    The play focuses on Ajax's refusal to accept the award of Achilles' armor
    to Odysseus, plotting to kill Agamemnon and Odysseus in revenge.
    Eventually, he is instead tricked by Athena and commits suicide out of
    shame. This exchange between Agamemnon and Teucer occurs after Ajax has
    left to impale himself on his sword; Agamemnon is accusing Teucer of
    supporting Ajax's assertion that he deserved the armor, leading to the
    present calamity.

## Going to Cleveland [^clevelandjohn] [^clevelandseries] [^cleveland] ## {#cleveland}

We both know you're leaving \\
You just don't want to say it yet \\
'Cause you don't want to hurt my feelings, so you \\
Gnaw your little holes in the net

And you torture me \\
With those big eyes \\
And you punish me \\
With pity \\
But I'm going to Cleveland

You say you wanted to strike first \\
Because one of us was leaving, that's what you say \\
But I've always been real fond of you \\
So I never would have treated you this way

And you torture me \\
With those big eyes \\
And you punish me \\
With pity \\
But I'm going to Cleveland

I hear the Cuyahoga [^cuyahoga] calling, now I know \\
What I was born for \\
And you say, "Hey, John", [^heyjohn] where are you going \\
But that's not my name anymore

And you torture me \\
With those big eyes \\
And you punish me \\
With pity \\
But I'm going to Cleveland

    to the very hard line that it's the absolute high water mark of the

    notes

[^clevelandseries]:
    Going to Cleveland is part of the [Going to ...
    series](series.html#goingto).

[^cleveland]:
    [Cleveland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland) is a major city in
    Ohio, located in Cuyahoga County on Lake Erie.

[^cuyahoga]:
    As [mentioned above](#fn:cleveland), Cleveland is located in Cuyahoga
    County. This most likely refers to the [Cuyahoga
    River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuyahoga_River), which follows a
    circuitous route from its source in Hambden, Ohio, south to roughly Akron,
    where it then turns and heads north to empty into Lake Erie. "Cuyahoga"
    means "crooked river" in some of the languages of the Iroquois tribes who
    are native to the area.

[^heyjohn]:
    From an early interview, John reveals that this is the first time John
    sings his own name:

    > P: I almost always assume that the person singing, is singing of their own
    > life...
    >
    > J: I think you can make a compelling argument for that, singing about
    > yourself, but usually I don't sing too directly. When I do it's kinda
    > scary. There's a song on the new Sonic Enemy tape, *Transmissions to
    > Horace* and on the first song I sing my own name. I remember the first
    > time I did it live it was very scary.

    Clayton, Buck. *The Mountain Goats Can't Buy a Thrill*. Puberty Zine. Date
    unknown, circa early 1990s.

## Early Spring ## {#early}

The pictures you paint aren't as pretty as they once seemed to me \\
And the coffee's bitter 'cause it's been boiling too long \\
And the jokes you tell aren't as funny as they once seemed to me \\
And the songs you sing are just plain hackneyed

But the stars shine down on all God's children \\
And the sun sets on the good and on the evil \\
And I know you \\
And I know you

The throbbing flowers outside, I get it \\
And the paint peeling from the bathroom walls \\
And the smile on your face, it's a lie \\
And the smile on your face, it's real pretty

And the sun shines down on all God's children \\
And the stars burn for the good and the evil \\
And I know you \\
And I know you

## Historiography [^historiography] ## {#historiography}

There was rain \\
There was wind \\
There was spring coming in \\
There was a feeling of approaching doom \\
And I was happy to see you \\
And it was cold in your room \\
And you were warm and that's all I remember \\
And your arms were warm and that's all I remember

Later on \\
Near morning \\
We were talking \\
About nothing \\
A little rain \\
A little wind \\
A quiet hall [^hall] \\
Cold air coming in \\
You were warm and that's all I remember \\
And your arms were warm and that's all I remember \\
And your eyes were pretty and that's all I remember \\
And your hands were soft and that's all I remember \\
And the hall was well-lit as I walked down it and that's all I remember \\
And the rain was light and it felt soft on my face and that's all I remember \\
And the car was quiet inside and that's all I remember \\
And it was dark but the sunlight was coming and that's all I remember

[^historiography]:
    [Historiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography) is the
    study of history itself and the techniques it uses, or alternatively, the
    sum of all historical scholarship on a topic.

[^hall]:
    Nall reports this lyric and the next line as "quiet cold cold air coming
    in", but I'm pretty sure I hear it as "hall", especially given the repeat
    of hall later in the verse. In the only live version I've heard, he sings
    it clearly as "A quiet hall".

## No, I Can't. [^nojohn] [^noalt] [^noseries] [^period] [^yesiwill] ## {#no}

*"Hi, it's the Mountain Goats. It's the 17th of December at 9:34 in the
morning, and this is called No, I Can't."*

You bought me some candy [^gifts] \\
And you bought me some flowers \\
And you bought me a sofa \\
And you bought me a radio

Thank you for the candy \\
Thank you for the flowers \\
Thank you for the sofa \\
Thank you for the radio

Now I have everything I need \\
Now I have everything I need

You bought me a puppy \\
And you bought me a lamp \\
And you bought me some books \\
And you bought me a filing cabinet

Thank you for the puppy \\
Thank you for the lamp \\
Thank you for the books \\
Thanks for the filing cabinet, I don't know what I did without it

Now I have everything I need \\
Now I have everything I need

You came by and you came in \\
And you let the wind in, it must be cold outside \\
We looked out through the sliding glass door \\
But I'd forgotten what we were looking for

Thank you for coming by \\
It's nice to see you once in a while \\
And thank you for the coat I'd forgot to mention \\
I've been freezing in here, I've been freezing in here

Now I have everything I need \\
Now I have everything I need \\
Now I have everything I need \\
Now I have everything I need \\
Yeah

[^nojohn]:
    "This is sort of a dance song." --- Crossing Border, Amsterdam, October 9,
    1999

[^noalt]:
    An alternate version of No, I Can't was released on [Songs for Peter
    Hughes](peter.html). The [absence of a period](#fn:period) in the spelling
    of the title on that EP as well as the [different lyrics](#fn:gifts) are
    discussed below.

[^noseries]:
    No, I Can't is part of the [informal series of alternate
    versions](series.html#demos).

[^period]:
    On Transmissions to Horace, this song is clearly spelled with a period
    terminating the title. However, on Songs for Peter Hughes, it's ambiguous
    in the song list and spelled without the period in the liner notes. On
    Bitter Melon Farm, where both songs are compiled, both are titled without
    the period. Given the lack of clarity, I've followed John's usage, using
    the period here, not using it on Songs for Peter Hughes, and using the
    convention established by the earlier release on Transmissions to Horace
    elsewhere (thus, using the period), but be aware that the song title often
    appears without it and the correct usage isn't obvious.

[^yesiwill]:
    John has alluded to there being a sequel, "Yes, I Will", but it's never
    been released or played live. Crossing Border, Amsterdam, October 9, 1999.

[^gifts]:
    The gifts enumerated are very different between the earlier Transmissions
    to Horace version transcribed here and the later Songs for Peter Hughes
    version. Further, the gifts described in live versions often vary wildly
    from the original, although all versions adhere to the general structure
    of the song. Other common variations include changing "bought" to
    "brought" in various places of the song.

    Given the many discrepancies between the two studio versions, the lyrics
    for the Songs for Peter Hughes version is transcribed in full below:

    > *"OK, go." "One, two, three, four."*
    >
    > You bought me some chocolates \\
    > And you bought me a rose \\
    > And you brought me a paper bag \\
    > And you brought me a lamp
    >
    > Thank you for the chocolates \\
    > Thank you for the rose \\
    > Thank you for the paper bag \\
    > Thank you for the lamp
    >
    > Now I have everything I need \\
    > Now I have everything I need \\
    > Now I have everything I need \\
    > Now I have everything I need
    >
    > You brought me a sofa \\
    > And you brought me some books \\
    > And you brought me a filing cabinet \\
    > And you brought me a Panasonic DX-4500
    >
    > Thank you for the sofa \\
    > Thank you for the books \\
    > Thanks for the filing cabinet \\
    > I don't know what I, I don't know what I ever did without it
    >
    > Now I have everything I need \\
    > Now I have everything I need \\
    > Now I have everything I need \\
    > Now I have everything I need

    The remainder of the lyrics are fairly similar.

    While John describes here a Panasonic DX-4500 (or occasionally and I
    assume accidentally, when live, a Panasonic DX-4800), what he actually
    recorded on was a Panasonic RX-FT500 (which he does occasionally sing
    live). I attribute this modification to John's delightfully labile memory.

    As mentioned above, when sung live, the gifts can also be in different
    orders or include new items not in either of the album versions. Other
    gifts include a shirt; a new shirt; some shoes; brand-new shoes; nice
    brown shoes; some apples; a stove; a brand-new stove; a sweater; some
    socks; a starfish; a Panasonic DX-4500 with dual cassette heads; a
    Panasonic AM/FM DX-4500; a Panasonic DX-4800 with dual cassette decks; a
    Panasonic RX-FT500, the one with the dual cassette decks (also erroneously
    sung as RX-FT5000); a Panasonic SS-4700 with dual cassettes; a camera; a
    monkey jug; a pound of coffee; a reading light; some pastels; some
    whiskey; a glass; fine silverware; a WHPK coffee mug; plateware; a Marantz
    PMD200 Professional Series; a really nice, really old Panasonic; an
    original 1978 copy of *Ãa plane pour moi* by Plastic Bertrand; a voter
    registration form which I'm extraordinarily grateful for; a wristwatch; a
    notebook; some plants; a subscription to *Road & Track*; a subscription to
    *Donk, Box & Bubble*, a blanket; a television; a record; brand-new
    microphone cable; a copy of Arab Strap's *The Weekend Never Starts Around
    Here*; the truly outstanding Arab Strap record; a sandwich; a table; a
    typewriter; a Dictaphone; an asp; a microphone; a Mr. Microphone; and a
    Fisher-Price toy microphone.

    If you know of others, please [let me know](../about.html#contact) and I'd
    love to hear about it!

## Alpha Desperation March [^desperationseries] ## {#desperation}

I'm coming in, try to stop me \\
Push furniture in front of the door \\
It only gives me something to push against \\
In the full heat of the summer's day \\
You're telling me to go away \\
But you owe me eight thousand dollars and I could use it

I'm only getting stronger, you may have noticed \\
But a head full of memories propels me ever forward \\
And in the living room I don't see where you are \\
But the back door's locked so you can't have gone far \\
And eight thousand dollars is a whole lot of money and I could use it

Could be that it's my imagination, but I think I hear you now \\
So come out, come out, wherever you are \\
Olly olly olly olly olly olly oxen free [^ollyoxenfree] \\
See I'm perfectly aware of where our love stands \\
But the plain fact is that you owe me eight grand \\
If it helps to jog your memory I lent it to you one Tuesday when we were drinking

Ha \\
Ha ha ha ah aha \\
Aha aha ah ah aha \\
Haha hahaha aha aha ah aha \\
Aha aha

[^desperationseries]:
    Alpha Desperation March is part of the [Alpha couple
    series](series.html#alpha).

[^ollyoxenfree]:
    "Come out, come out, wherever you are" and especially "[olly olly oxen
    free](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_olly_oxen_free)", are phrases
    associated with the children's game [hide and
    seek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hide_and_seek), in which all but one
    player hides, the last player counting down while blinded until reaching
    some predetermined time before searching for them. If the seeker gives up
    before finding all of the hiders, they can shout, "Olly olly oxen free",
    meaning that the remaining players can come out of hiding without losing.
    Many variations of the game exist with different rules regarding the
    phrase and variations of the phrase itself, which is of uncertain origin.

## Going to Monaco [^monacoseries] [^monaco] ## {#monaco}

*"... he and the sergeant dropped to the ground in the shadow below a bush.
They heard a branch crack to the left. Then the sound of footsteps. Two of the
renegades carrying firewood, a third with a rifle, were walking toward them,
closer and closer."* [^monacointro]

The sea gobbles up the full sun, and I \\
I look at you and I know you're the one \\
The one I used to know something about \\
And I try to say what it was, but the words won't come out \\
And you ask me to hold you \\
That's the devil's work

You show your palms and I see they're empty \\
And I'd check them twice if you'd let me \\
But you wouldn't do that now, would you \\
I didn't think so \\
And you ask me to hold you \\
But that's the devil's work

We stand on the sand and we watch the world turn \\
And we stand on the sand and we watch the water burn \\
And we stand on the sand six inches from one another \\
And the sands burn and blow but neither one of us runs for cover \\
And you ask me to hold you \\
That's the devil's work \\
And you ask me to hold you \\
But that's the devil's work

[^monacointro]:
    Unfortunately, I've been unable to figure out what this is from. It sounds
    like a clip from an old radio drama. If you know, please [send me an
    email](../about.html#contact).

[^monacoseries]:
    Going to Monaco is part of the [Going to ... series](series.html#goingto)
    and the [informal series of Biblical references](series.html#bible).

## Star Dusting [^starjohn] [^starseries] [^stardust] ## {#dusting}

*"Hello, it's the Mountain Goats at 10:24 on Sunday the 20th of December, and
this is a horror story."*

Toward the end of our first year in Las Vegas [^vegas] \\
You looked up from your little corner \\
And I saw that your face was getting a little brighter \\
And you asked me, is it really getting warmer \\
Or is it just me, and then you started mumbling unintelligibly \\
So what are you saying anyway

I thought I heard bells ringing, but then I remembered \\
That I no longer knew what bells sounded like \\
I thought we'd maybe strike up a conversation \\
'Til bad luck cruised by on his ten-speed bike \\
I got real cold and I grabbed my coat \\
And I saw that the ringing was coming from your throat \\
What are you saying anyway

[^starjohn]:
    This is one of the few Alpha couple songs that neither has Alpha in the
    title nor is related to the Tallahassee release:

    > The seeds of Tallahassee are in this song, right. This was a story that
    > --- I liked the feeling when they're boiling someone alive. Heavy stuff. I
    > don't know about that, anyone deserves that. Question of what anyone
    > deserves is a pretty complex philosophical question. People in this song
    > deserve better than each other. They're not going to get it. Best they can
    > hope for is to be in the seventh song on a tape on the Sonic Enemy label
    > called Transmissions to Horace.

    Bottom of the Hill, San Francisco, June 14, 2014; Taking the Dative liner
    notes.

[^starseries]:
    Star Dusting is part of the [Alpha couple series](series.html#alpha).

[^stardust]:
    Given that the Alpha couple stayed for a year in the [Stardust Resort and
    Casino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_Resort_and_Casino)
    (discussed in the [Taking the Dative liner notes](dative.html#liner), I
    think it's reasonably certain that this refers to the same hotel, a famous
    casino located on the Las Vegas strip until its closure in 2007.

[^vegas]:
    [Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas) is a major city in
    southeast Nevada, known for its decadence and legalization of gambling.

## Teenage World ## {#teenage}

You bought me a rabbit to keep me company \\
And I'm here in my car and the rabbit's here with me \\
Heading out Highway 1 [^ca1] respecting posted speed limits \\
And I tried to figure this one out but I can't find any meaning in it \\
And I'm sick and tired of trying to figure out your gestures \\
And I'm sick and tired of wondering what your presents mean \\
I'm gonna take this rabbit into Malibu [^malibu] \\
And he'll chew on sourgrass while I bolt down Dexedrine [^dexedrine] \\
Dexedrine

The wind comes through the open window and I button my shirt \\
And the rabbit's riding shotgun, my teeth hurt \\
You sent me a package marked 'live animals inside' \\
And the sun's coming up quickly above the rising tide \\
And I'm sick and tired of trying to figure our your gestures \\
And I'm sick and tired of wondering what your presents mean \\
I'm gonna take this rabbit into Malibu \\
And he'll chew on sourgrass while I bolt down Dexedrine \\
Dexedrine

[^ca1]:
    Highway 1 is a common highway name and could refer to a number of freeways
    throughout the United States and elsewhere. However, given John's
    California origins and the reference to Malibu, I believe that this refers
    to [California State Route
    1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_1), a major
    north-south highway that runs up the coast of the state, becoming the
    main street in Malibu as it passes through that town.

[^malibu]:
    [Malibu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu,_California) is a wealthy
    beach town just northwest of Los Angeles, famous for its beaches and the
    numerous celebrities that live there.

[^dexedrine]:
    [Dextroamphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine), also
    known by the brand name Dexedrine, is a psychoactive stimulant drug used
    medically to dread attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and
    narcolepsy. Chemically, it is structurally identical to amphetamine, but
    only contains the dextrorotatory stereoisomer of amphetamine,
    (2S)-1-phenylpropan-2-amine, whereas amphetamine refers to the racemic
    compound, (RS)-1-phenylpropan-2-amine.

## Going to Santiago [^santiagoseries] [^santiago] [^santiagointro] ## {#santiago}

Big birds in the trees \\
Car's locked and I've lost my keys \\
Crashing sounds of the waterfall \\
And a statue of Jesus 200 feet tall [^statue] \\
Three thousand miles from the port in California \\
And three little feet from falling off the earth \\
And the shadow of a mountain should cast a shadow \\
And the snow underfoot is soft and yielding \\
La la la la la la la la \\
La la la la la la la la \\
La la la la la la la la

Look at those birds \\
I'd say something about them but I've lost the words \\
They're laughing and they're watching me \\
And the radiator's boiling for no reason \\
The wild cattle crossing as it strikes their fancy \\
And a handful of money which does me no good \\
And a pocketful of medicine to abuse myself with \\
And a photograph of someone stapled to my shirt seam \\
La la la la la la la la \\
La la la la la la la la \\
La la la la la la la la

[^santiagoseries]:
    Going to Santiago is part of the [Going to ...
    series](series.html#goingto) and the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^santiago]:
    [Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago) is a major city and the
    capital of Chile.

[^santiagointro]:
    This trumpet line is sampled from *I Don't Know Why*, played by [Ray
    Anthony and His Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Anthony). The
    original song, [*I Don't Know Why (I Just
    Do)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Don%27t_Know_Why_(I_Just_Do)) was
    written in 1931 by Fred E. Ehlert with lyrics by Roy Turk, both of whom
    were eventually inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Multiple
    versions of the song have charted into the Billboard Top 20, including
    those by the Andrews Sisters, Linda Scott, Wayne King and His Orchestra,
    and Tommy Dorsey and His Orchestra from the 1930s through the 1960s.

    Thank you tremendously to Soren Spicknall of the tMG podcast Isopanisad
    Radio Hour (more info [in the credits](#credits)) and his friends for
    finding the origin of this sample!

[^statue]:
    Tall statues of Jesus are found all around the world. Unfortunately, I
    haven't found any located in Santiago, so I'm not sure if this refers to a
    particular one.

## Sail On [^sailoncover] ## {#sailon}

Sail on down the road \\
About half a mile or so \\
Well, I tried to make you stay \\
But now you're going

It was plain to see \\
That a small-town boy like me \\
Just wasn't your cup of tea \\
That was wishful thinking

Gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy \\
You gave me nothing in return \\
You know it ain't so hard to say \\
Would you please just go away [^name]

You come to comfort me \\
But I don't need your sympathy \\
And the way you look at me \\
Well, it's condescending

I feel my stomach churn \\
And didn't you ever learn \\
Not to tell somebody something \\
If you don't mean it

I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy \\
You gave me nothing in return \\
You know it ain't so hard to say \\
Would you please just go away

Sail on \\
Sail on \\
Sail on

[^sailoncover]:
    Sail On is a [cover](series.html#covers) of the top-ten charting 1979 song
    by the [Commodores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodores). The song
    was written by Lionel Ritchie and released on the Motown label.

    Accordingly, Sail On is part of the [informal series of cover
    songs](series.html#covers).

[^name]:
    The original song includes another verse instead of this one, which John
    has occasionally sung in live versions:

    > I don't mind about the things you're gonna say \\
    > I gave you my money and my time \\
    > I know it's a shame \\
    > But I'm giving you back your name

    Bottom of the Hill, San Francisco, June 13, 2006.
