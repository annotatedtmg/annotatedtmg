[^alphaseries]:
    This album and every song on it is part of the [Alpha couple
    series](series.html#alpha). For much, much more information on the couple
    in general, see there.

    See for example Bottom of the Hill, San Francisco, June 23, 2011, American
    Theater Company, Chicago, May 16, 2010, and [the Mountain Goats 4AD

    for confirmation.

[^alphahistory]:
    "\[The album is\] about these people I've been writing about forever that I
    sort of abandoned --- well, I didn't abandon them, I couldn't take it any
    more. They don't have any names, it's a man and a woman, they're from...
    Southern California, and they get married because they think that's a good
    idea. Now, this is where the trouble begins. They get married, and
    immediately, to celebrate their marriage, they begin drinking. And they
    drink a lot. And then they drink some more. And predictably, there really
    isn't much marriage because they're so narcissistic that they can't really
    --- they do love each other, but they don't know how to do that. So there
    they are, married, you know. And you get married, that's a big thing to do.
    So they figure if they move, that will help --- a lot of people think that.
    So they move to Nevada, and they live in a motel room drinking for about a
    year. Now, while I would recommend this as a step for marriage counseling
    --- you never know what could work and what couldn't --- that doesn't pan
    out for them, and so they flee across the country, trying to sort of escape
    the ghosts that are actually living inside of them. That was why I stopped
    writing about them, because when they got down to Tallahassee, I really
    felt like they got kind of raw. And this is weird to talk about, but they
    get down there and they buy a house and they live in it and they figure,
    you know, 'Here we are, we're married, and we bought a house, right, and so
    here we are, so we can do this'. They can't do this.  But they want to. And
    so the album is about the fact that they want to." --- [Bottom of the
    Hill][2002-10-23], San Francisco, October 23, 2010

From the above sources:

"The album was about these characters I'd dreamed up a long time ago; their
broader story involved an alcohol-soaked trek from California through Nevada
and then bottom-crawling across the country until they wound up in northern
Florida."

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

We came into town under cover of night, because we were pretty sure the people
here were going to hate us once they really got to know us. It was summer.
It's always summer with us. In our lives together, which are sweet in the way
of rotting things, it is somehow permanently summer.

THE MOON rose above the trees, older than time, greener than money. You hung
your head out the window of our dusty lemon-yellow El Camino [^elcamino] and
howled, and I turned up the radio, because the sound of your voice was already
beginning to get to me. The speakers crackled and the music came through:
Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. *Pretty as a midsummer's morn, they call
her Dawn.* [^valli] Let the love of God come and get is if it wants us so bad.
We know were we are going when all of this is done.

SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY that buying a house you've never actually seen close-up
is a bad idea, but what does anybody know about *our* needs, anyhow? For us it
was perfect. The peeling paint. The old cellar. The garden in the back. The
porch out front. The still air of the living room. The attic. Everywhere
entirely unfurnished and doomed to remain largely so, save for our own meager
offerings: a cheap sofa, an old mattress, a couple of chairs and some
ashtrays. Maybe a table salvaged from some diner gone into bankruptcy, I don't
remember. Neither do you. We drank store-brand gin with fresh lime juice out
of plastic cups or straight from the bottle and we spread ourselves out
face-up on the wooden floors. An aerial view of us might have suggested
we'd been knocked down, but what we were doing was staking our claim.
Establishing our territories. Making good. Not on the vows we'd made but on
the ones we'd really meant. You produced a wallet-sized transistor radio out
of nowhere and you found a sympathetic station: somebody was playing Howlin'
Wolf. *Smokestack lightning.* [^howlinwolf] O yes, I loved you once. O yes,
you loved me more. We entered our new house like a virus entering its host.
You following me, me following you. However you like. The windows were high
and the walls were thick and sturdy. It was hot as blazes. The guts of summer.
Always down in the sugar-deep barrel-bottom belly of summer itself. Always. In
our shared walk down to the bottom, which bottom we will surely find if only
our hearts are brave and our love true enough, we have found that it is
somehow invariably and quite permanently summer.

Thank you for all your goodness: all TMG posse members past, present, & future;
\[...\] anybody who ever made a record that got described as "ambient dub,"
[^dub] anywhere, ever; anyone who reviewed said album(s) favorably so long as
they didn't get all flowery about it; independent record stores who stock said
ambient dub albums and keep the dust from gathering on their anti-theft
packaging; clerks at chain stores who attempt to order such records, only to be
rebuffed by the senior buyer when caught, and lectured rather sternly and
rudely besides; and the dashing Swedish tenor Jussi Bjorling. [^bjorling] The
Mountain Goats do not themselves play ambient dub, or if they do, do so with
such total lack of attention to the most basic elements of the genre that their
efforts can only be described as falling so wide of the mark as to have missed
it entirely. Jussi Bjorling, should he rise from the grave, will in fact put
his tenor to entirely novel use by assisting us in honing the focus of our
efforts in the ambient dub field. We look forward to this project with almost
painfully sharp hunger and hope that you share our admittedly puzzling
enthusiasm for it.

*"Leading cases are the very stuff of which the common law is made, and no
leading case in the common law is better known than that of Regina v. Dudley

in London. In it, two profoundly respectable seamen, Captain Tom Dudley and
Mate Edwin Stephens, lately of the yacht Mignonette, were sentenced to death
for murder of their shipmate, Ordinary Seaman Richard Parker, after a bench of
five judges had ruled that one must not kill one's ship-mates in order to eat
them, however hungry one might be."* [^regina] \\

[^elcamino]:
    The [Chevrolet El
    Camino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_El_Camino) was a popular
    and stylish coupé utility from the late 1950s through 1980s.

[^valli]:
    [Frankie Vallie and the Four
    Seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Seasons_(band)) were an
    American pop group from the 1960s and 1970s. The lyric "Pretty as a
    midsummer's morn / They call her Dawn" is from their song [Dawn (Go
    Away)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_(Go_Away)).

[^howlinwolf]:
    [Howlin' Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howlin%27_Wolf) is one of the
    classic American bluesmen. He wrote and recorded the blues song
    [Smokestack Lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokestack_Lightning)
    in 1956. His recording of the song earned him a Grammy award and became
    a signature of his body of work.

[^dub]:
    [Ambient dub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music#Ambient_dub) is
    an electronic music genre blending elements of ambient and dub, forming an
    atmospheric, largely lyricless, spacey, reggae-influenced style.

[^bjorling]:
    [Jussi Bjorling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussi_Bjorling) was a major
    Swedish tenor opera singer from the 1930s through 1960s.

[^smith]:
    Susy Smith was a purported psychic and author of many books on
    parapsychology and related pseudosciences, such as ghosts, ESP, and
    consciousness after death.

[^regina]:
    [*R v Dudley and
    Stephens*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Dudley_and_Stephens) was a
    major British court case in which, as described, two seamen were sentenced
    to death for eating their companion to reduce the chance of their own
    demise. The ruling established that murder was unacceptable even if it
    seemed necessary to save one's own life, and was the topic of enormous
    public controversy due to the public of the time's sympathy towards
    castaways. The case is still studied in common law areas, and the incident
    remains influential in popular culture.

[^simpson]:
    [A. W. B. Simpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._W._B._Simpson) was a
    law professor at the University of Michigan and historian of British law.
    *Cannibalism and the Common Law: The Story of the Tragic Last Voyage of
    the Mignonette and the Strange Legal Proceedings to Which It Gave Rise*
    was one of his many publications, focusing entirely on the described
    cannibalism case and its ramifications.

[^lerner]:
    [Jimmy Lerner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Lerner) is an American
    poet and author, famous for his writings about being imprisoned in Nevada
    for manslaughter. Lerner was controversial for both the differences
    between his account of events and that of the police, and for being the
    case which struck down Nevada's Son of Sam law, which prohibited criminals
    from profiting from writing stories about their crimes.

    The lines here are from his poem *Fence Skeptic*, published in his
    collection of poetry, *It's All Part of the Punishment* and originally
    published in the poetry journal *Rattle*:

    Mommy warned me not to do it --- \\
    Jimmy, don't put that bobby pin \\
    in the outlet --- \\
    daddy drove me to the emergency room, \\
    mommy still in shock.

    Daddy warned me not to do it --- \\
    Jimmy, don't touch the hot stove, \\
    you'll burn your hand --- \\
    mommy drove me to the hospital, \\
    daddy still steaming.

    They say the fence here is electrified \\
    that this is how some of us learn, \\
    beneath the guntowers \\
    behind the razor wire.

    I stroll the yard, \\
    my keen convicted mind \\
    wondering \\
    if the fence to freedom \\
    will really deliver 50,000 volts.

    "This is a song about alcoholism... this song is about the miracle of love
    for a couple of people hell-bent on destroying themselves and one another,
    in that order." --- St George's, Bristol, October 7, 2013.

    Describing Tallahassee's place as the opening track, John says, "In the
    case of 'Tallahassee' it seemed like a scene-setting song: it introduced
    the principal characters, established that there's been a movement from
    the other side of the country to here, and took one last look in the rear
    view at the thing they once had that's now in collapse. *Last look through
    more than one door* as Joan Didion would have it. *Water under the bridge
    and dynamite it behind you.*"

[^heyjohn]:
    Several people have pointed out that it sounds like someone is saying
    "Hey, John" very faintly over and over at the beginning of the track.
    John's statement on this is simply, "There is a thing there. It may be a
    voice though I'm not 100% clear on that. I'm reasonably certain it's not
    saying 'hey, John' but that's all I've got on this question at this time."
    He has later called this a ghost in the recording, discussing how no one
    is sure what this sound is or how it got there.

    "This is a love song about people who aren't in love any more... Yes, it is
    sad, and to combat the sadness they've taken to drinking, I'm sorry to
    report. It helps them feel better sometimes, other times it makes them
    feel bad. They have unfortunately learned that the only way to combat that
    bad feeling is to drink more. They've taken to drinking the cheap stuff.
    It tastes horrible and gives you awful headaches." --- Black Cat,

    "This is a song about the morning when you say to yourself, 'Divorce will

    how exactly, it's not any particular thing. It's not like, you know --- on
    the Lifetime Movie Network there might be one signal event, you know, but

[^tampa]:
    [Tampa][tampawiki] is another Floridian city. The Alpha connection here is
    unclear, as Tampa is farther south from Tallahassee, meaning that it's not
    on their route from Las Vegas.

    John writes that the influence of poet John Berryman, a Tampa native, and
    a line from the song *The Wells Fargo Wagon* in the 1962 film *The Music
    Man* contributed to his use of Tampa throughout his work. William Caxton

    "I looked at a map of Tallahassee and there's this road out past the
    tracks, and then I wrote to a Mountain Goats fan that I know down there
    and I said, 'Would you live down there?' 'No, that wouldn't be a place
    you'd want to live.' 'Is property cheap down there?' 'Oh, yeah, yeah.' And
    so, I wanted them to have a house that they could maybe actually buy, but
    they haven't held jobs in forever, these people, so it'd need to be a
    cheap, very run-down house, and so, so I put it there." --- VPRO session,

    "Last time we were in Tallahassee, we were driving around, and I spotted
    this house. And as you may know, new album's called Tallahassee, and it
    takes place in this single house in Tallahassee that this married couple
    have inhabited as they drink their love into the ground. And we spotted
    this house, this abandoned place, and I went, 'Jesus, that looks like it,
    that could be their place, eh?' And we stopped, and it just had this
    ghostly, horrible aura to it, you know, it was condemned. The door was
    open, we went in --- I couldn't stand to go deeper than the first room,
    there's broken bottles and cigarette butts everywhere, and I thought, 'Oh
    my God, this is where they did their thing." ... It turned out that it was
    on Monroe Street, instead of elsewhere. We passed it on the way to the
    Beta Bar last night, and it had been razed to the ground... This is a song
    about a house, and two people who were once in love. Now they're not, but

## Game Shows Touch Our Lives [^gameshowsjohn] ## {#gameshows}

Dug up a fifth of Hood River gin, [^hoodriver] and \\
That stuff tastes like medicine \\
But I'll take it \\
It'll do

On the couch in the living room all day long \\
Music on the television playing our song \\
And I'm in the mood \\
The mood for you

Turn the volume up real high \\
All of that money look at it fly [^moneyfly] \\
And you smoking like a chimney [^newports] \\
Shadows crawled across the living room's length \\
I held onto you with a desperate strength \\
With everything \\
With everything in me [^useless]

And I handed you a drink of the lovely little thing \\
On which our survival depends \\
People say friends don't destroy one another \\
What do they know about friends?

Thunderclouds forming, cream white moon \\
Everything's gonna be OK soon \\
Maybe tomorrow \\
Maybe the next day

Carried you up the stairs that night \\
All of this could be yours if the price is right [^priceisright] \\
I heard cars headed down to oblivion \\
Up on the expressway \\
Your drunken kisses as light as the air [^wasted] \\
Maybe everything that falls down eventually rises \\
Our house sinking into disrepair \\
Ah, but look at this showroom filled with fabulous prizes

    "I'll tell you how the song title was born... So, we're watching the E!

    you know, Pat Sajak, Alex Trebek, Vanna White, yeah, and Chuck Woolery,
    and the guy from Joker's Wild, whatever the hell that guy's name was...

    "This is a story about, as it happens, sometimes, that you find yourself
    in a house with a person who shares your enthusiasm for vodka, and you
    happen to have a TV. It's so nice to have a TV when you have all that
    cheap vodka and cigarettes that you buy bulk from one of those cigarette
    and batteries stores off the highway there. And maybe the cigarettes are a
    little stale, but maybe after a couple of slugs it doesn't matter so much,
    and then you have the TV, and you have the vodka, and you have the
    cigarettes, and you have each other." --- Wow Hall, Eugene, June 21, 2005

## The House That Dripped Blood [^bloodmovie] ## {#dripped}

Look beyond the broken bottles \\
Past the rotting wooden stairs \\
Root out the wine-dark [^winedark] honeyed center \\
Not everyone can live like millionaires

Look through the air-thin walls \\
Tear up the floorboards, strip the paint \\
Go over every inch of space \\
With the patience of a saint \\
Grab your hat, get your coat \\
The cellar door is an open throat

Look past the kitchen cabinets \\
Go through the chest of drawers \\
Scrutinize the casements \\
Rip the varnish off the doors \\
Dig up the laughing photographs \\
They're here somewhere or other \\
Take what you can carry \\
But let me tell you brother \\
Still waters go stagnant \\
Bodies bloat \\
And the cellar door is an open throat

[^bloodmovie]:

Full of promise and potential \\
More clay pigeons \\
For you and me \\
All of them, all of them \\
All of them, all of them \\
All of them, all of them, all of them, all of them \\
All lined up

Huge crows \\
Loitering by the curb \\
Our shared paths \\
Unraveling behind us like ribbons \\
And I dreamed of vultures \\
In the trees around our house \\
And cicadas and locusts \\
And the shrieking of innumerable gibbons [^stolen] \\
All of them, all of them \\
All of them, all of them \\
All of them, all of them, all of them, all of them \\
All lined up

How long will we ride this wave out? \\
How long 'til someone caves under the pressure? \\
My dreams are haunted by armies, armies of ghosts \\
Faces too blurry to make out \\
Numbers far too high to measure

Your face \\
Like a vision straight out of Holly Hobbie [^hobbie] \\
Late light \\
Drizzling through your hair \\
Your eyes \\
Twin volcanoes \\
Bad ideas \\
Dancing around in there \\
All, all of them, all of them \\
All of them, all of them \\
All of them, all of them, all of them, all of them \\
All lined up

I hope that our few remaining friends \\
Give up on trying to save us \\

To piss off the dumb few that forgave us \\
I hope the fences we mended \\
Fall down beneath their own weight \\
And I hope we hang on past the last exit \\
I hope it's already too late \\
And I hope the junkyard a few blocks from here \\
Someday burns down \\
And I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away \\

I hope I lie \\
And tell everyone you were a good wife \\

I hope it stays dark forever \\
I hope the worst isn't over \\
And I hope you blink before I do \\
Yeah, I hope I never get sober \\
And I hope when you think of me years down the line \\
You can't find one good thing to say \\
And I'd hope that if I found the strength to walk out \\
You'd stay the hell out of my way \\

You are coming down with me \\

    vamped on it, I went, 'I hope you die, I hope you die', right? And I

And meet me on the way down \\

And walked the two miles to the bus stop

Thumbed a ride to Cedar Key [^cedarkey] \\

## Peacocks [^peacockmicrosite] ## {#peacocks}

I hear them squeal \\
I see them preen \\
Fans all spread out \\
Neat and clean

Grab hold of the morning \\
Head out to the porch \\
Feel the wind stopping \\
Feel the sun scorch \\
I fear for my safety \\
You can see it in my eyes \\
In an hour or two \\
We will rise

Then a sharp breeze kicks up \\
I hug myself hard \\
How come there's peacocks \\
In the front yard [^peacockmicrosite]

Sun's all prickly \\
On my neck \\
When the helicopter passes \\
We both hit the deck \\
Hands grasping and groping \\
Seizing opportunity right where it lies \\
The sky will fall \\
We will rise

[^peacockmicrosite]:
    On the [Tallahassee microsite](#microsite), peacocks are found in the
    front yard, alongside a pamphlet titled *The Shocking Truth About
    Peacocks*. The pamphlet states:

    Peacocks have a highly developed language, and are thought by many
    scientists to be the only animal besides man capable of expressing itself
    abstractly.

    In prehistoric cultures the peacock has been observed to hold totemic
    status. Archaeological evidence strongly suggests that several American
    communities prior to the continental drift considered the peacock an omen
    of death or disaster, and left ablutions at the entrances to their
    dwelling-places before retiring to sleep nightly.

    Between 1970 and 1978, peacocks were directly or indirectly responsible
    for no fewer than 37 deaths in the upper Ohio Valley --- more than any
    other animal, predator or prey, in the same region during the same
    timespan.

    Some peacock mating rituals can take as long as one full calendar year.

    Peacocks mate for life, but one mate will often attempt to kill the other
    just prior to migration.

    Contrary to popular belief, peacocks do not eat their young.

    However it is generally conceded that peacocks are scavengers, and will
    submit wholly on carrion for whole seasons at a time.  Many once-prominent
    aviculturalists have left the profession entirely after tending to
    peacocks through several seasons.  The turnover race within the profession
    is equalled only by that of severe trauma wards in urban hospitals.

    "This is a song about the tender feelings people experience toward one
    another when they are in love and they have tender feelings. It should

    making the food run, and he didn't realize we were tracking... I remember
    it happening, and I \[thought\], 'Oh God, this is a pretty good take, and
    now I'm going to have to do it again", and I'm a very irritable person when
    it comes to multiple takes... I feel like I'm in my zone and out of the
    corner of my eye I see Peter come in with, like, a sandwich. And he walks
    in...  \<laughter\> But if you listen to the song on Tallahassee, you can

## Old College Try [^collegejohn] [^collegetry] ## {#college}

From the housetops to the gutters \\
From the ocean to the shore \\
The warning signs have all been bright and garish \\
Far too great in number to ignore \\
From the cities to the swamplands \\
From the highways to the hills \\
Our love has never had a leg to stand on \\
From the aspirins to the cross-tops to the Elavils [^quaaludes] [^elavil] \\
But I will walk \\
Down to the end with you \\
If you will come all the way down with me

From the entrance to the exit \\
Is longer than it looks from where we stand \\
I want to say I'm sorry \\
For stuff I haven't done yet \\
Things will shortly get completely out of hand \\
I can feel it in the rotten air tonight \\
In the tips of my fingers \\
In the skin on my face \\
In the weak last gasp of the evening's dying light \\
In the way those eyes I've always loved illuminate this place \\
Like a trashcan fire in a prison cell \\
Like the searchlights in the parking lots of hell \\
I will walk \\
Down to the end with you \\
If you will come all the way down with me

[^collegejohn]:
    "It's about the love we have in our hearts for our own eventual
    destruction. You look yourself in the mirror sometimes and you feel the
    tenderness that a person can only feel for him or herself when he knows
    that doom is imminent." --- Troubadour, Los Angeles, December 16, 2011

    "You know how in some operas, usually not the good ones, there'll be some
    sort of... guy'll come out and basically tell you what to expect... Guy
    comes out and says "Well, you'll be seeing me and I'll be divorcing my
    wife and then by the end of the play we'll all be quite miserable and I
    hope you enjoy it and pay us afterwards." ... This song is sort of like
    that moment from Tallahassee where everybody is announcing that, you know:
    "Looks as though divorce is what's next for us, eh? Let's get everything
    lined up for the big ugly divorce, shall we?" And they sort of look each
    other in the eyes and say "Yes, let's!" --- Remis Auditorium, Boston,

Thought I'd finally beat the feeling back \\
It all came back today \\
And then we fell down \\
And we locked arms \\
We knocked the dresser over as we rolled across the floor \\
I don't mean it when I tell you \\
That I don't love you any more \\
Look at that \\
Would you look at that? \\
The way the ceiling starts to swerve \\
What will I do when I don't have you \\
When I finally get what I deserve?

[^kilink]:
    My best guess is that this refers to either of the cult Turkish superhero
    films Kilink Istanbul'da or Kilink Uçan Adama Karşı, in which
    [Kilink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_(comics)), a criminal
    dressed as a skeleton, battles a man who can turn into Superman. However,
    neither films contain a swordfighting scene, so this line may refer to a
    different unauthorized Kilink film, or a film about the related
    superheroes and supervillains Diabolik, Satanik, and Kriminal. Both of the
    films mentioned are available on the Internet Archive. [Kilink

## Alpha Rats Nest [^ratsjohn] ## {#rats}

Ah, the lengthening hours in the refinery \\
Belching fire into the sky \\
We do our best vampire routines \\
As we suck the dying hours dry \\
The night is lovely as a rose \\
If I see sunlight hit you \\
I am sure that we'll both decompose

Ah, the fitful sleep and the fire engines \\
That I dream of when I dream \\
Someday we'll both wake up for good \\
I will try hard not to scream \\
The evening wind will shake the blinds \\
You're stirring from your slumber \\
We've got something hateful on our minds

Oh, sing, sing, sing \\
For the dying of the day [^thomas] \\
Sing for the flames that will rip through here \\
And the smoke that will carry us away \\
Yeah, sing for the damage we've done \\
And the worse things that we'll do \\
Open your mouth up and sing for me now \\
And I will sing for you

    "Most albums that I write I don't know what the order of the songs is
    going to be while I'm writing... But I always knew this was going to be
    the last song on Tallahassee." --- Zoop - Farm Sanctuary, New York, June
    17, 2007

    John had considered [naming the album *Bottom
    Feeders*](#fn:alternatetitles), including writing the following lines for
    the title track:

    If you don't give a rat a pellet \\
    He's not going to push the lever \\
    Take one last look at the West Coast \\
    Say goodbye forever

    The rat in these lines became the rat of Alpha Rats Nest. William Caxton

    Plausibly an inversion of the refrain of the celebrated villanelle [Do not go
    gentle into that good
    night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_go_gentle_into_that_good_night)
    by the great Welsh poet [Dylan
    Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas), which goes, "Rage,
    rage against the dying of the light". The poem is transparently about
    death, and is in full:

    > Do not go gentle into that good night, \\
    > Old age should burn and rave at close of day; \\
    > Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
    > 
    > Though wise men at their end know dark is right, \\
    > Because their words had forked no lightning they \\
    > Do not go gentle into that good night.
    > 
    > Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright \\
    > Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, \\
    > Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
    > 
    > Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, \\
    > And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, \\
    > Do not go gentle into that good night.
    > 
    > Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight \\
    > Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \\
    > Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
