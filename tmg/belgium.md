[^belgium]:
    [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium) is a multilingual country
    in northwestern Europe.

    "The album is sort of a series of snapshots of tweakers, right, speed
    freaks, which was a very popular thing when I lived in Portland, and ---
    not the speed freaks themselves, but the speed. And speed freaks, like
    everybody else, but with a particular vengeance, talk about how they're
    gonna get the hell out of wherever they're at, right, and go to someplace
    where, you know, it's sort of like the chemical land of milk and honey.
    Where they're usually gonna go to Amsterdam, right. And I knew one who
    went to Amsterdam, and then tried to bring stuff back in his pockets,
    right, and wound up in a European jail. Ah, how can you blow it that bad?
    You know, he showed up at the airport high as a kite, and they just took
    him in. But yeah, so, Belgium is sort of my speed freak cast's, their
    Kubla Khan, you know, that they have in their mind, that they're all going
    to go to Belgium, but actually, their own personal Belgium is a sort of
    hellish place. --- KEXP session, May 21, 2004

## Nova Scotia [^novascotiaseries] [^novascotia] ## {#novascotia}

Coming in off Nova Scotia \\
Yellow sun in the blue sky \\
All those cattails [^cattail] in the wind \\
I got something in my eye

Listen \\
Everything I love I will devour \\
And bury the bones down in the snow \\
Put me in a beat-up El Camino [^elcamino] \\
Just let me go, just let me go

## Attention All Pickpockets [^pickpocketsseries] [^pickpocketsjohn] [^cd] ## {#pickpockets}

*"And, the new song, which has no title as of yet."*

In comes you \\
Not the same person I knew \\
Looking roughly the same \\
But something hungry getting restless in your brain \\
Hey

So there I go \\
Not the same person that you used to know \\
Peeking through \\
The fisheye lens at you

And the cornet blows [^coronet] \\
Where the oleander grows [^oleander] \\
And us too \\
Not the same people that our old friends knew

And so down the street \\
You head in the high summer heat \\
White long-sleeve Oxford [^oxfordshirt] \\
Pushed up to just before your elbows

Black pumps and a medium-length black skirt \\
Eating a path through the dark, damp earth \\
I hope they've got \\
Plenty of money where you're going

And the cornet blows \\
Where the oleander grows \\
And us too \\
Not the same people that our old friends knew

[^pickpocketsseries]:
    Attention All Pickpockets is part of the [informal series of
    outtakes](series.html#outtakes).

[^pickpocketsjohn]:
    "This was recorded during an incredibly hot week. I went to Paris for this
    thing called the Mofo Festival... I sat down; I looked at the sign on the
    wall that had been stolen from some French alley, you know, that said,
    'Attention aux Pickpockets', you know, 'Danger of Pickpockets' is what it
    meant. But I read it wrong on purpose and made it say, 'Attention All
    Pickpockets'. And sat down, wrote a quick lyric --- the lyric turns out
    actually to have been a study for the song Dilaudid, the same people."

    As mentioned above, Attention All Pickpockets is about the same person as
    [Dilaudid](sunset.html#dilaudid). Zoop, Farm Sanctuary, New York, June 17,
    2007; [Are 'Dilaudid' and 'Attention all Pickpockets'
    related?](http://johndarnielle.tumblr.com/post/62058054518/are-dilaudid-and-attention-all-pickpockets-related),

[^cd]:
    Attention All Pickpockets was only included on the CD; it was omitted from
    the 7".

[^coronet]:
    John fairly clearly pronounces this "coronet". However, a
    [coronet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronet) is a type of crown; what
    he presumably meant was [cornet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornet), a
    brass instrument similar to a trumpet but with a different timbre.

[^oleander]:
    Oleander is a common name for [Nerium
    oleander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerium), a toxic but colorful
    flowering plant which grows throughout southern Europe and the
    Mediterranean, as well as east to parts of China.

    An [Oxford shirt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_(cloth)) is a dress
    shirt made from Oxford fabric, a variety of basketweave cloth.
