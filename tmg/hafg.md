[^caveat]:
    John has always been clear with his feelings about leaked albums, namely,
    that artists should have the right to release their work if and how they
    want. His words say it best:

    > For those who're curious, yeah for sure the whole Gothenburg deal has
    > had a chilling effect on me - I now delete/erase/destroy anything I
    > don't feel like I'll wanna release, since I don't want this sort of
    > thing to happen again. That makes me sad, 'cause I used to have archives
    > of all sorts of weird stuff that at some point would all have been given
    > out for free. New world, different rules!
    >
    > ... I'm just kinda touchy about this subject, since it does seem like
    > people often say "hey, if you didn't want people to hear it, you
    > shouldn't have even recorded it," which is, as I say, pretty limiting to
    > one's creativity.

    and:

    > it is my preference that people not listen to this stuff - obviously
    > nobody's gotta respect my preference, though it's kinda weird that
    > people are so cavalier about it ("well, I want it; end of story" :) - it
    > hurts my feelings. If that's "thin-skinned," well, whatever y'know?
    > That's how I am.  I make myself available to people who like my stuff,
    > and I'm open with them; it's one of the things that makes me different
    > from other music dudes...
    >
    > to answer your question though - everybody who records makes HUNDREDS of
    > songs they don't want anyone to hear, if not thousands. One learns from
    > recording stuff. It's a valuable process, and it can be instructive to
    > return to stuff and see how it went - what the process was. Now I know
    > better than to leave it hanging around, and I destroy stuff I don't want
    > people to hear. Such is the world, nothing to do about it!

    Issues around this leak and a sense of entitlement to music John chose not
    to release has resulted in the cancellation of at least one EP (West Texas
    Orphans) and probably many songs not being released that otherwise would
    have been. A substantial amount more information is available in the
    forums.

    This website exists in a strange balance. On the one hand, I actually
    share John's often-repeated love of ephemeral things. I've made one some
    significant art projects where the piece would never have had the impact
    it had on me and the other people involved if it survived, and making it
    again would be against the point. I love that some things that the
    Mountain Goats have made will never circulate outside the small group that
    initially participated in them, and I strongly support the tape trading
    culture that is opposed to everything being permanently uploaded to the
    internet, instead having more personal interactions. On the other hand, I
    love learning more about the Mountain Goats and other artists, and sites
    like this have helped me enormously with other things I fell in love with.
    I've found as I've dug deeper and deeper into the band's music that many
    people feel the same and want to share the joy and knowledge they have.

    I don't know where the line is, although I'm always aware of it, and
    there's a number of things that I refrain from hosting on the site in
    deference to that ideal, although I know I probably make more of the music
    easily accessible than John might be otherwise comfortable with. There's a
    great article [by Daniel
    Fries](https://killscreen.com/articles/praise-digital-era-obscurity-mountain-goats/)
    on this topic that I recommend reading if you have the time.

    In any case, my position out of respect to John is that I will not
    facilitate anyone obtaining or listening to these songs. Please don't ask,
    and please also don't be a dick about this album (or Golden Boy, or any of
    the other irritations that have reduced how close John has been to fans
    over the years). Given that for many years the album has been listed on
    [Nall's website](http://themountaingoats.net/music/hafg.html), and that
    the majority of these songs have been played live, I feel that it's OK to
    share information about the release and the individual songs.

    The tape that leaked is mastered too fast, with the result that John's
    voice and guitar are approximately one tone too high.

    Being unreleased, there is no official cover art for Hail and Farewell,

    In a particularly amazing live show (Castro Theater, San Francisco,
    December 14, 2010), many songs and outtakes from Sweden and Hail and
    Farewell, Gothenburg, were played live as the score to the Swedish silent
    film [Sir Arne's
    Treasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Arne%27s_Treasure) for the San
    Francisco Film Society. Songs were not played in order but matched to
    scenes; for example, as Arne's house was burned to the ground by the three
    marauders, John played [Snow Crush Killing Song](sweden.html#snowcrush),
    which has the subtitle, "[The house was burned down by the young
    man.](sweden.html#fn:snowcrushsubtitle)"

[^unreleased]:
    Hail and Farewell, Gothenburg was never released. Likely recorded in 1995
    after Sweden, it was leaked in 2006 (to the best of my knowledge).

    Strangely enough, it was listed in the discography found in the Japanese
    issue of [All Eternals Deck](aed.html).

## Hello, Old Rabbit ## {#rabbit}

I saw the long row of bluebells \\
Saw the foxglove and the nightshade [^flowers] \\
I saw the whole garden and I thought a while about \\
How I've been waiting for you since the second grade

The flowers made the air boil \\
The boiling air made me think of you awhile \\
I did not come here to suffer \\
I did not come here to suffer

I heard the ducks all quacking \\
I saw the sunshine on the lake \\
Saw you standing near the water \\
And wondered how long I'd be paying for one dumb mistake

The sight of you was really something else \\
But I don't know what that something else was \\
I did not come here to suffer \\
I did not come here to suffer

## You're So Vain [^vainseries] [^carlysimon] ## {#vain}

Well, you walked into the party \\
Like you were walking onto a yacht \\
Your hat strategically dipped beneath one eye \\
Your scarf it was apricot

You had one eye on the mirror \\
And you watched yourself a lot [^gavotte] \\
And all the boys [^female] dreamed that they'd be your partner \\
They'd be your partner, yeah [^chorus]

Well, you had me several years ago \\
When I was still quite naive \\
And you said that we made such a pretty pair \\
And that you would never leave

But you gave away the things you loved \\
And one of them was me \\
I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee [^coffee] \\
Clouds in my coffee, yeah

Well, I heard that you went off to Saratoga [^saratoga] \\
And your horse naturally won \\
And then you charted a Learjet to Nova Scotia [^your] \\
To see the total eclipse of the sun [^eclipse]

Yeah, you're always where you should be \\
And when you're not you're with \\
Some underworld spy or your best friend's boyfriend [^female] \\
Your best friend's boyfriend, yeah

[^carlysimon]:
    [You're So Vain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_So_Vain) was a
    1972 hit single by musician Carly Simon. The song rose to the #1 position
    on the Billboard Top 40 and is certified gold by the Recording Industry
    Association of America. Simon has stated that each three verses refers to
    a different person. The only identity she has confirmed is that the second
    verse is about actor Warren Beatty.

[^female]:
    The song is originally sung from a female perspective, and so the original
    is different in several ways. In the second stanza of the first verse, the
    line is, "And all the girls dreamed that..." Similarly, the final two
    lines of the last stanza are, "Some underworld spy or the wife of a close
    friend / Wife of a close friend, and".

[^chorus]:
    John's version omits the chorus. The original contains the following lines
    after every verse:

    > You're so vain \\
    > You probably think this song is about you \\
    > You're so vain \\
    > I'll bet you think this song is about you \\
    > Don't you, don't you

    John has stated that he didn't have a reason that he recollects for
    leaving the chorus out, and that as the album was released without his
    permission much of the music isn't as he intended.

[^coffee]:
    Simon wrote the following about the origin of this phrase:

    > The only phrase that remains from that first effort came when I was
    flying to Palm Springs with Billy Mernit, my piano player and great friend
    since my summer camp job when I met Jake in '68. Sitting next to me on the
    airplane, Billy pointed out the reflection in my cup --- something he'd
    noticed with his keen photographer-lyricist's eyes: "Check it out, you've
    got clouds in your coffee."
    >
    > I took out my little black book and wrote it down. You never know. The
    talent is in catching the right casual quip.

    The phrase later became the title of her [1995 retrospective box
    set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clouds_in_My_Coffee).

## Four New Trees ## {#newtrees}

The first new tree is tall and good \\
It gives hard, dark, brown, burning wood \\
For when winter comes; it stands right outside \\
With its blossom-laden arms spread wide

The second new tree gives out sweet, sticky fruit \\
And it took a long time to take root \\
Sometimes we thought it had given up the spirit \\
But now it makes me happy when I'm just standing near it

The third new tree stands just west of the barn \\
Its best branches no thicker than my arm \\
I will water him every day \\
And I will chase all the termites away

But the fourth new tree \\
Is my enemy \\
Yeah, the fourth new tree \\
Shouldn't be here

The fourth new tree \\
Sends its tendrils through the water mains and tries to poison me \\
Its leaves are thick and always falling \\
And pure

## I Love You. Let's Light Ourselves on Fire ## {#fire}

What's going to be the death of me \\
Static electricity \\
What's making me take it all too far \\
You are \\
You are

What's keeping me up at night \\
The street light \\
What's finally gonna let me sleep all right \\
You might \\
You might

How do I know what I know \\
Where did our love go \\
How come the river froze over this year \\
What are we hiding here \\
I saw you waiting by the mailbox \\
Saw the mailman come \\
Saw the neighbors poke their heads out of their windows \\
I saw everyone

## Milk Song ## {#milksong}

When the sky was the color of cream \\
And you started leaving messages on my answering machine \\
Telling me that you were way across town \\
And would be home in a night or two

I started keeping track of my losses \\
There were only one or two I couldn't cover \\
And up there against the milk-white sky \\
I saw fleeting vestiges of you

The way you vanished gradually \\
Has made a bitter man of me \\
And the way you vanished gradually \\
Has made a bitter man of me

Where the ocean cleaves the rocks real clean \\
I dropped my answering machine \\
I watched the waves chew it into tiny little pieces \\
Saw the seafoam hissing in the air

On the balance sheet I'd been keeping in my mind, I entered \\
Two hundred kronors [^kronor] to the left of the debit line \\
It was what the machine had cost me \\
It was a greater loss than I could bear

I hear the wheels and knobs whirring down to this very day \\
Long after the ocean has washed it all away \\
I heard the train go by last night \\
And it's a slow train out of here all right

But the way you disappeared in slow degrees \\
Has made a very patient man of me \\
Yeah

[^kronor]:
    The [Swedish krona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_krona), meaning
    "crown", is the base unit of currency in Sweden since 1873. In 1995, \$1
    US exchanged for approximately 7 -- 8 kronor. The krona has had purchasing
    power parity with the US dollar in recent years, perhaps with a slight
    advantage historically, and so the value of 200 kr is around \$20 -- \$25
    US.

## Ghosts [^ghostsjohn] ## {#ghosts}

I went down the road today \\
Just in the old way \\
And a black dog hobbled past me \\
His tags jangled on his collar

It made me wish I was dead \\
It made me wish I was dead

And the familiar sun on me \\
Just like it would always be \\
Rocky soil, dry land \\
Knew it all like the back of my hand

It made me wish I was dead \\
It made me wish I was dead

Terrific view from here \\
Skies clear \\
Sun's high \\
I let things lie

And I know what is and isn't mine \\
And it was good to get back to the sunshine \\
But five years is a long time \\
And I spent five years in Sweden dying for you \\
I spent five years in Sweden \\
Dying for you

## Red Choral Diamond Spray ## {#spray}

As we pull into the harbor in New York today \\
And I ask you how you're doing, you swear up and down you're OK \\
But I can see what's gotten into your eyes \\
It's written all over your face tonight \\
We will never see Ireland again \\
We will never see Ireland again

As we hang up the map on the motel wall \\
Count up the places that we've left behind, add the distances between them all \\
All the bridges someone's burned down for us \\
All the chances that we burned all by ourselves

Makes us wonder what we were thinking then \\
'Cause we will never see Ireland again \\
We will never see Ireland again \\
We will never see Ireland again

## Ending the Alphabet [^alphabetseries] ## {#alphabet}

We got the brightest skyline [^skylight] \\
Like a vision of heaven on the evening sky \\
And a clocktower two blocks from the spot \\
Where I'm standing tonight

And the avenues are throbbing with people \\
And the late sunlight makes them all look like angels \\
And the transformation is seamless \\
They are unbearably bright

I can almost hear their voices \\
As I walk past them all toward the water \\
What is there left in a city like this \\
When everyone you know is gone

I saw the wind wash them all away \\
And I was freezing

[^alphabetseries]:
    It's unclear to me whether Ending the Alphabet should be considered part
    of the [Alpha couple series](series.html#alpha) or not. In content it
    isn't obviously about the couple, although by my read it could go either
    way. I have no evidence to say not and so by my rubric of including all
    songs with Alpha in the title, I am conservatively adding it until other
    information surfaces.

[^skylight]:
    Nall writes this lyrics as, "[We got the brightest
    skylight](http://www.themountaingoats.net/lyrics/hafg_lyr.html#ending). I
    can't honestly tell whether he's right or not, but skyline makes more
    sense to me. If you have evidence one way or another, [drop me a
    line](../about.html#contact).

## Crane ## {#crane}

Picked up a fat gold watch for you \\
Down where the river washes over the avenue \\
And I listened to it tick away the minutes \\
Looked out at the awful sky

I was afraid that my arm was broken \\
But it was only kind of run down \\
I went walking after 2 last night \\
Felt like I was the only guy in town

And I'm not, I know \\
And I don't need you to tell me so \\
Look at this watch \\
Look at this watch \\
You won't believe what this thing can do

## One Frozen River ## {#frozen}

When my old friend came crawling up the hill \\
Broken and bloody \\
Carrying her hair in clumps in her hands \\
I let her right on in \\
I let her right in

When she stood near the kitchen window \\
Staring out at the countryside \\
And then she looked my way \\
I let her right on in \\
I let her right in

And when she was stronger than she'd been before \\
I opened the front door \\
And I opened the back door \\
And the sunlight poured in \\
Yeah
