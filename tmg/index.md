# Hi, we're the Annotated Mountain Goats #

Welcome!

This is a comprehesive, accurate, and referenced guide to the first 25 years
of the music of the Mountain Goats. The site covers the boombox, early studio,
biographical, and later studio eras of the band. This period, lasting from
approximately 1992 to 2017, contains a massive corpus of staggering
complexity, range, and humanity. This site does not include releases from 2017
on, after the band moved on stylistically and thematically. 

Pick the release you're looking for. In the below tables, links indicate
annotations. Links *in italics* are incomplete: those prefixed with a dash (-)
contain lyrics but have yet to be annotated; those prefixed with a plus (+)
instead need transcription as well. If you'd like to help, please [read
here](about.html#contributing) and [reach out](about.html#contact)!

## Introduction ## {#intro}

The objective of this website is to provide a comprehensive, referenced source
for information about the lyrics of [the Mountain Goats][tmg]. John's
commentaries and details about obscure references can all be found inside. If
you'd like to contribute, please let me know! I'd love to hear from you and if
I've gotten something wrong, or you have more information, send it in.

[tmg]:      http://mountain-goats.com

Many of the references are from comments John has made at live shows. If these
are reported, it's always from a recording so it can be verified. All of these
are available online, in the [forums][], or elsewhere. If you can't find the
source and you'd like to confirm a quote, feel free to shoot me a line.
Similarly, in the live show directory, the only tapes listed are those whose
existence I've been able to personally verify.

[forums]:   http://www.mountain-goats.com/forums/

Many references and excellent banter are left unannotated. The goal of this
website is to help discover and understand the Mountain Goats as opposed to
revealing every gem. Listening to live shows and banter yourself will continue
to yield moments which cannot be had otherwise. Many particularly amazing
descriptions are summarized rather than quoted, and a great deal of banter not
pertaining to explaining a song are left for the listener to discover. John
himself has said with some frequency that [he doesn't believe in parsing every
detail][parsing] --- that the meanings of songs change and should be
interpreted by the listeners. That said, I love hearing what he thinks about
his music, hence this website. So, please be careful with overanalyzing and
avoid dogma as you use these annotations.

## Buttons ## {#buttons}

Once upon a time, I made buttons for each Mountain Goats tour and passed them
out at shows and through the mail. They were 100% free; I made them with my
button maker. A fellow DIY fan has been making stickers and those are
available here as well! While I no longer travel to shows like I used to,
there are still a few remaining buttons from those years.

To see the designs, and for information about how to obtain some, [see

## Splits ## {#splits}

Collaboration records are put in the albums, EPs, or singles categories as
appropriate, as given the nature of the Mountain Goats it feels artificial to
me to distinguish between the nebulous nature of the regular band at times and
a formal collaboration. True splits are listed below, along with true
collaborations with bands outside the traditional Mountain Goats canon.
Collaborations John makes with other bands released under their names are
annotated on the other collaborations page.

Multiple additional Congress releases exist, specifically [Full Term][full]
(1995), [The Farm Out Back][farm] (1991), [She Lies in Roses][roses] (1989),
[We All Fall Down][fall] (1985), [Sleeping Under Angels' Wings][sleeping]
(1985), and [Election Year][election] (1985). All were released under the
Cache Cow label on cassette. These are not listed above since I've never been
able to find copies of them.

The [official Mountain Goats discography][discography] claims that there is a
Seneca Twins demo. However, this is [known to be incorrect][johnseneca], and
this recording is actually a live show, and accordingly is listed in the [live
show](live.html) page. One track off of a rehearsal tape is available.

John has occasionally released material under other names, such as the
Comedians (an early name for collaborations between Darnielle and
Vanderslice), Yamaraja Racers (a cover band for himself), and others. These
are documented as if they were released as Mountain Goats titles, since other
than the name they are indistinguishable from Mountain Goats material. #tcot
(a project with Christopher R. Weingarten) is a similar two-person
collaboration but is listed separately given how different the material is.

John | August 17, 2007 04:29PM | Re: seneca twins
it's fine to do whatever you like with this one. there were, like, thirty? -
don't remember - cassettes pressed up & I think distributed by Lalitree as
part of her semester in Chicago - can't remember the name of the arts program
she was doing there that September-December.

I don't know where you heard that C., it's just a live thing, you guys know I
wouldn't release a live album. I do like that the only document that exists of
this pretty-decent-little-band is a live recording (and a practice tape
someplace). This was the only show we played.

man I dig those song titles, I was trying to hit a slightly different vein
that autumn.

## Credits ## {#credits}

First, thank you, John Darnielle, for making music that has inspired and moved
me so much, over and over again. Words cannot describe what your music means
to me. Thank you.

I owe a huge thanks to one man in particular: Christopher MacMurray, often
known as [Caliclimber][], who I became friends with at a show and who has
encouraged my love of the Mountain Goats in every way possible. He's also
produced several truly remarkable Flickr albums, which detail almost every
piece of Mountain Goats [cover art][], [related cover art][], [posters][], and
[Extra Glenns and Lens cover art][extra-covers], from which I and others have
cribbed heavily. Thank you for everything, Cali, you are the best.

I also would like to thank [Jon Nall](http://themountaingoats.net/) for
producing his remarkable website, for being the Mountain Goats archivist, for
unknowingly exposing me and so many others to information about so much great
music, and for inspiring this website. Thanks for paving the way.

Many people have offered information, discussion, feedback, criticism, advice,
corrections, and rare praise regarding the contents of this site. Particularly
I would like to thank the denizens of the [Mountain Goats forums][forums] for
much discussion and analysis helping me to find more information, the
[Mountain Goats subreddit][reddit] for similar reasons, and commenters on many
websites (particularly on [Songmeanings][]) for helping me track down obscure
references. Of these people, four in particular stand out: Thomas Fidler, also
known as [Drumhax][], [Riley Routh][riley], who spontaneously drafted entire
pages about albums and spurred me to write more, [Wil Hall][wil], who
transcribed entire albums' worth of lyrics, and Stephen Plummer, a frequent
chatter on [#themountaingoats][irc], whose impeccable memory and knowledge of
live material corrected many errors in the live show directory. Thank you all!
You have made this website so much better.

I was inspired to make this website in part because of other annotations that
helped me fall more deeply in love with music and literature that kept me
alive back in the day (and now). So a deep thank you to the fans who curated
these incredible sites and books:

* Frank Zappa --- Román García Albertos: [Information Is Not Knowledge][fz]
* The Grateful Dead --- David Dodd: [The Annotated Grateful Dead Lyrics][dead]
* Tool --- Kabir Akhtar: [toolshed][tool]
* The Pogues --- Fran Moran: [The Parting Glass][pogues]
^
* American Gods --- Renata Sancken: [only the gods are real][gods]
* Alice's Adventures in Wonderland --- Martin Gardner: [The Annotated
  Alice][alice]
* Riddley Walker --- Eli Bishop: [Riddley Walker Annotations][eb]
* The Hunting of the Snark --- Martin Gardner: [The Annotated Hunting of the
  Snark][snark]

Lastly, thank you to all fans of this amazing band for being an extraordinary
community and for supporting excellent independent music.

"I have no particular conclusion to give in a rambling piece about nothingness, save for my gratitude to God, the Mountain Goats, and \[the author of the Annotated Mountain Goats\], and my hope that all our beings and becomings will find themselves freed from their bonds on some glorious day."

I wish could bring myself to agree with Elle above --- and I have to admit
that my trout-like comrade from England has a point. Either way it brings me
great joy to hear that other people have enjoyed the site. Have anything to
say about the site, positive or negative? [Get in
touch!](../about.html#contact) I'd love to share your thoughts here.
