### Liner notes ### {#liner}

*(cassette):*

UTINAM NE IN NEMORE PELIO SECURIBUS CAESA ACCIDISSET ABIEGNA AD TERRAM TRABES

--- Ennius.

(Would that the fir branches felled by axes in the Pelian forest had not
fallen to the earth.) --- see also side II, song #7.

was recorded by the Mountain Goats and the Bright Mountain Choir in 1992--3 in
California and it looks like this:

Side A: Pure Milk. Ice Blue. Water Song II. Sun Song. Going to Japan. Are You
Cleaning Off the Stone? The Hot Garden Stomp. Love Hymn to Aphrodite.

Side B: Beach House. Hello There Howard. Going to Norwalk. Fresh Cherries in
Trinidad. Feed This End. 15--1. Thanks For the Dress. Tell Me On A Sunday.

All songs by the Mountain Goats except Tell Me On a Sunday which is by Andrew
Lloyd Webber + Don Black. We are Rachel, John, Sarah, Amy, and Rosaaane, and
people who say otherwise are LIARS.

Russell Hill, [^geethanks] Franklin Bruno, Mark Givens, Dennis Dennis Dennis,
Steve Kronk, the heavenly Choir, the Scripps Classics Department without whom
Side II song 7 could not have been written, Leticia, and Cato the Elder.

...PEACE! I HATE THE WORD / AS I HATE HELL, ALL MONTAGUES, AND THEE!

Special thanks to Shakespeare and to Thomas WYATT for importing the sonnet to
England.

[^geethanks]:
    This is the full text of what is visible on the original cassette. In the
    reissue CD booklet, "Gee, thanks to" is added at the beginning of this
    sentence. If you look closely it appears that this was intended to make
    the original cassette release and just wasn't photocopied onto the J card
    --- you can see what is likely the bottom of the comma at the top of the
    page.

*(reissue booklet):* [^reissue]

The songs you find on this compact disc originally appeared on two cassettes.
To elaborate further about that --- to say, for example, that the songs
originally appeared "on two cassettes that were released in \_\_\_\_ and
\_\_\_\_" --- would misrepresent the spirit of their time. These tapes did not
have release dates. No-one anticipated their coming into the world, and very
few noticed or cared. Among those who did, reaction was fairly evenly split.
Some people thought these tapes were kind of cool. Other people thought they
sucked. One can make, without much effort, a good case for either side of the
proposition.

All previous eras cross at some point into the territory of the unimaginable,
and so it is with the days of tape-trading. The obscurity in which these songs
were incubated & born & brought into their faint light is a state of being
which has passed into history. I don't keep diaries and I have a pretty
hostile mistrust of nostalgic impulses, so anything I remember about these
songs is shaded by having grown from the excitable young would-be poet &
terrible guitarist who wrote them into the excitable less young would-be poet
& improving guitarist who writes today. If I could speak to that younger
writer, I would explain patiently to him that stalker narrators are neither
interesting nor edgy, so he might want to refrain from writing "The Garden
Song," lest his feminist activist older self feel embarrassed in the future.
Through the impenetrable calcite wall of time I am pretty sure I can hear the
younger writer responding that he sees my point, but that there is also a song
about cows.

## Pure Milk ## {#milk}

The moon's full \\
And the sky's bright \\
And so you and me \\
Are gonna get drunk tonight

We're gonna steal some tractors \\
And head on into town \\
Find the main strip \\
And start mowing them down

Don't come to the window \\
'Til you're sure it's me \\
Don't ignore the obvious \\
Take a deep breath

Put your hand on the goddamn radio \\
Put your hand on the goddamn radio

The fields are full of spirits \\
But no one cares at all \\
And the light above you flickers \\
When you hear me call

And I'm shaking when I see you there \\
'Cause I don't know what it means \\
But the ground is looking dry tonight \\
And bursting near the seams

So don't come to the window \\
'Til you're sure it's me \\
Don't ignore the obvious \\
Take a deep breath

Put your hand on the goddamn radio \\
Put your hand on the goddamn radio \\
Yeah

## Ice Blue ## {#ice}

The sky was pale \\
The day was gloomy \\
Boy, your eyes burned through me

Thought that I knew what colors were \\
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha

Thought that I knew what colors were \\
Before I saw you \\
Ice blue

## Water Song II ## {#water2}

They'll be singing out loud \\
When the water goes through the crowd \\
They'll be howling for you \\
When the waves come crashing through

I brought my friend, here he comes \\
Splashing and gurgling for you \\
Now the water runs through the streets unimpaired \\
Crashing through

They'll be saying your name \\
Every voice different, every word the same \\
They'll be holding you up \\
Too close to the sun, but I will make them stop

I brought my friend, here he comes \\
Splashing and gurgling for you \\
And now the water runs through the streets unimpaired \\
Rushing through

Still start singing, [^unclear] and you'll stand in the light \\
When my friend gets here he will set things right \\
They'll be singing for one thing and they'll get this instead \\
Let them come and get me, let them strike me dead

I brought my friend, here he comes \\
Splashing and gurgling for you \\
Now the water runs through the streets unimpaired \\
Rushing through

And I brought my friend, here he comes \\
Splashing and gurgling for you \\
And now the water runs through the streets unimpaired \\
Rushing through

[^unclear]:
    It's hard to hear this first phrase. Nall [doesn't write down
    anything](http://www.themountaingoats.net/lyrics/garden_lyr.html#water),
    and the few live versions haven't shed any light on it due to being sung
    too differently. If you have a live version that clarifies this or better
    hearing than me and think you know what this says, [get in
    touch](../about.html#contact)!

## Sun Song ## {#sun}

The sun was a yellow eye in a blue face \\
When you came over to my place \\
And you said how things look dead around here \\
Well, that's all right if things look dead around here \\
'Cause it's only a little while longer \\
Things are gonna look dead around here

And there are certain gardening skills \\
That you don't have yet \\
And there are certain gardening skills \\
That you'll never learn \\
How to leave alone what's doing fine \\
How to mulch what's dying on the vine \\
There are certain gardening secrets \\
You don't know

You said the soil looked nitrogen poor \\
Well, don't you worry about the soil looking nitrogen poor \\
I think that's my problem if the soil is nitrogen poor \\
But for myself it looks kind of nitrogen rich

And there are certain gardening secrets \\
You don't have yet \\
And there are certain gardening skills \\
You'll never learn \\
How to leave alone what's doing fine \\
How to mulch what's dying on the vine \\
There are certain gardening secrets \\
You don't know

## Going to Japan ## {#japan}

There's a north wind coming in \\
And there's a west wind coming in \\
And there's an east wind coming in \\
And there's a strong wind blowing in from the south \\
And there's a sweet metallic taste in my mouth \\
There's a dead feeling lingering over the land \\
And there's a one-way ticket in my hot little hand \\
And I'm kissing your eyelids and I'm going to Japan

There's life and liberty on my tongue \\
And there's a dead silence where the wind chimes hung \\
And on some mountain somewhere in the world it's snowing \\
But here in the fields there's not a thing growing \\
Maybe next year, you know, there is no way of knowing \\
There's wind coming from all directions \\
There's a coat on my shoulders, midnight connections \\
I'm kissing you and leaving you behind in the sand \\
I'm holding you a while and then I'm going to Japan

## Are You Cleaning Off the Stone? ## {#stone}

I'd to begin by saying that I saw you coming \\
But that would be a lie \\
I'd like to say that I could hear your voice \\
But I couldn't mean "hear" in the accepted sense of the word

Are you cleaning off the stone \\
That's a sweet thing to do \\
Are you cleaning off the stone  \\
That's sweet of you

They tell me your hair's gotten much, much longer \\
I bet it looks nice \\
They tell me your eyes are the same color as they always were \\
That kind of information just floors me

Are you cleaning off the stone \\
That's a sweet thing to do \\
Are you cleaning off the stone  \\
That's sweet of you

Are you cleaning off the stone \\
That's a sweet thing to do \\
Are you cleaning off the stone \\
That's sweet of you

## The Hot Garden Stomp ## {#stomp}

The room was unbearably hot \\
Flowering plant that hung from the radiator pipe \\
Was dripping sweat from its rapidly fading petals

And to the humming world in which I was living \\
A crescendoing stepping sound came in \\
Heard you stepping over three weeks worth of newspapers \\
Piled up outside the door

I hear you knocking \\
Come in \\
Turn on the radio \\
Turn up the volume

You sat down in the same place where you used to sit \\
It brought back a memory or two \\
May not know much anymore \\
But I remember you

You were quiet for a while and that was nice \\
They you came along with your questions, always questions \\
I don't have any answers \\
For those particular questions

I hear you talking \\
Shut up \\
Turn on the radio \\
Turn up the volume

## Love Hymn to Aphrodite ## {#aphrodite}

*"The actual date is the 17th of April. Love Hymn to Aphrodite."*

The sunset gets a little longer every night \\
And it's no good, but I feel all right \\
The sky turns orange and the colors start swirling \\
You float downstairs, your body spinning \\
In perfect circles \\
It's the 18th of July \\
What, what are you doing [^drums]

[^drums]:
    A sample from what sounds like a circle of hand drums plays at the end of
    this song. If you know what this is from, please [email
    me](../about.html#contact)!

## Beach House ## {#beach}

I get letters telling me since I moved away \\
You've taken to hanging out on that rock about a mile from shore \\
Given what I know about that rock, namely, that it's populated by seals \\
I'd strongly suggest to you that you not hang out there anymore

'Cause the seal is a wily and a vicious creature \\
And the seal will bite you if you give him half a chance \\
Yeah, the seal has a mind set on violence \\
And the seal is the sworn enemy of man

Now when I say that the seal is vicious, I use the term advisedly \\
According to Webster's 9th New Collegiate, definition 4b \\
States that vicious means, "marked by ferocity" \\
And offers as a synonym, "savage"

'Cause the seal is a vicious and a wily creature \\
And the seal has a mind full of evil designs \\
And the seal will harm you and laugh about it \\
Yeah, the seal is not a creature you want to toy with \\
Yeah, the seal is not a creature you want to toy with

## Hello There Howard ## {#howard}

The guy on my right is new \\
And he says he feels kind of sad and his hands are cold \\
And he refuses the dice so I pick 'em up myself \\
I let 'em roll

And the little white spots gleam like stars \\
The guy on my right gets a look at the stick man \\
And he begins to sense where it is that we are \\
And the table's hot \\
And so am I \\
And I grab the bones and I let 'em fly \\
So come 2, come 3, come 4, come 5, come 6, come 7, come 9 \\
It doesn't matter to me now 'cause I got all kinds of time

## Going to Norwalk ## {#norwalk}

At 1:30 on a Thursday night \\
I saw a pair of raccoons heading to the gutter \\
They stopped at the storm drain \\
Their tails hung down and out of sight \\
They looked up at me \\
Their eyes were shining \\
I thought of you

I can't stand \\
The way the moon expands \\
And fills out the corners of the California sky \\
I can't stand it

The old buildings stood tall against the sky \\
The windows had old sheets hanging over them \\
Doubling as curtains \\
And the silhouettes moving in the bright lights behind the curtains \\
Looked like you \\
I stopped moving moving momentarily

The world will \\
Stand still on nights like these \\
Without any kind of warning \\
And I can't stand it

## Fresh Cherries in Trinidad ## {#trinidad}

When I woke up on Saturday and you came in \\
And you brought the sunlight in \\
I felt sleep slipping away from me \\
I feel things occasionally \\
Like this \\
Fresh cherries \\
Hanging from your fingers

When the water on the window lit the sunlight through \\
And I got a good look at you \\
Standing above me bright and tall \\
There are no words for it, there are no words at all \\
I saw \\
Fresh cherries \\
Hanging from your fingers

## Feed This End ## {#feed}

*"All right." \\
"Come here, you." \\
"What?" \\
"Today I want you to be my love slave." \\
"Yes, master, oh you! Oooh." \\
"It goes both ways." \\
"It does?" \\
"Mmm, yeah." \\
"You want me to be your love slave?" \\
"Uh-huh."*

Stood near the cage of the prize-fighting cock \\
Sun cut through the clouds but the air pressure dropped \\
And I touched your hair for the very first time \\
I have that moment with me now, it's all mine

And you showed me a thing or two about power \\
In its purest form

A few minutes later you went back inside \\
And I stood near the clothesline where strips of beef dried \\
Hanging in the noonday sun, flies were buzzing nearby \\
And then your face in the window caught my eye

And you showed me a thing or two about power \\
In its purest form

Things don't look much different now from where I stand \\
Looking for you, camera in hand \\
Someone's gone away, and someone's gotten taller \\
But the world stopped turning, and the universe is much smaller

Since you showed me a thing or two about power \\
In its purest form

Yeah, you showed me a thing or two about power \\
In its purest form

## 15--1 ## {#n15}

If I had a car and you were riding in it \\
I'd show you what my car could do \\
I'd head east out Highway 15 \\
And see the starlight shower over you

Gas fumes rising from the blacktop \\
Cheap motels with flashing signs \\
Just an old sweet song made new \\
And oozing through the pines

If I had thirty dollars and I could make time stop \\
And the moon was high up above \\
And moonbeams fell like sweet cream \\
Then the night air would carry our dark dreams

Gas fumes rising off the highway \\
Neon flashing everywhere \\
Just an old sweet song made new by your body \\
And desert flowers blooming in the thick night air

## Thanks for the Dress ## {#dress}

*"He'll still be like ---" \\
"--- so good. She has ---" \\
"--- needing us ---" \\
"--- tell you about personal testimony." \\
"Please keep feeding us."*

The young sun \\
The old story forming \\
Hasn't been the same \\
Since dad came by this morning

Did you see the way mom's looking at us \\
Mark it well

Your eyes meet mine \\
When we hear her call \\
The strange birds in the yard \\
Are perched above the symbols that she painted on the garden wall

Did you see the way mom's looking at us \\
Did you see the way mom's looking at us \\
Don't say anything

## Tell Me on a Sunday ## {#sunday}

Don't write a letter \\
When you want to leave \\
Don't call me at 3 AM from your friend's apartment

I'd like to choose \\
How I hear the news \\
Take me to a park that's covered with trees \\
Tell me on a Sunday, please

Let me down easy, no big song and dance \\
No long faces, no long looks, no deep conversation

I know the way \\
I want to spend that day \\
Take me to the zoo with big chimpazees \\
Tell me on a Sunday, please

Don't want to know who's to blame, it won't help knowing \\
I don't want to fight day and night, it's bad enough that you're going \\
Don't leave in silence with no words at all \\
Don't get mad and slam the door, it's no way to end this

I know how I \\
Want you to say goodbye \\
Find a circus tent with a big trapeze \\
Tell me on a Sunday, please

I don't want to fight day and night, it's bad enough that you're going \\
Don't leave in silence with no word at all \\
Don't get mad and slam the door, it's no way to end this

I know how I \\
Want you to say goodbye \\
Go right off in the pouring rain \\
Don't call me as they call your plane \\
Take the hurt out of all the pain \\
Take me to a park that's covered with trees \\
Tell me on a Sunday, please
