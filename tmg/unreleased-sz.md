## Saigon Shrunken Panorama ## {#panorama}

The last vestiges of empire were crumbling \\
Daisies were pushing through the ground \\
And I saw a crane disappear beneath still water \\
On the day when you came back around \\
And though time remembers meaningless gestures \\
Your goodness will not be forgotten while I am still alive \\
It was the eighteenth day of May in 1975 [^may1975]

And I asked if you could last a week or two \\
And you said you thought you could \\
You came inside then with the light trickling behind you \\
It was fine and it was good \\
And so gleams the single moment \\
Before we heard the officers arrive \\
On the eighteenth day of May in 1975

Hey

[^may1975]:
    This date is shortly after the [Fall (or Liberation, depending on your
    point of view) of Saigon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Saigon) at
    the end of the Vietnam War on April 30, 1975.

## Scavenger Babies ## {#scavenger}

Wake up all the birds of prey \\
Dig your tools out from the clay \\
Seal the exits of your room \\
Watch the cactus flowers bloom

And send my regards to the boys down on the corner \\
Yeah, send my regards to the boys down on the corner

Build a house from sticks and mud \\
Listen to the poison singing in your blood \\
Pull yourself a tall cool drink \\
Carve your initials in the bathroom sink

And send my regards to the boys down on the corner \\
Yeah, send my regards to the boys down on the corner

The city of Norwalk in my dreams \\
Rises like Atlantis from a watery grave \\
Burn the things you have to burn \\
Save all the people you're supposed to save

And send my belongings to the drop box in Tijuana \\
And send my regards to the boys down on the corner

## \[Shield My Eyes Against the Glare\] ## {#glare}

Up the hallway and out into the air \\
Shield my eyes against the glare \\
Blacktop bubbling in the heat \\
Satan rising from the street

I don't care much \\
Wildflowers wither at my touch \\
And I'll burn too \\
Before I get through

Down the street, step short and sweet \\
Watch for the hand behind the curtain \\
There is no trace of it \\
Not anywhere, so I shield my eyes against the glare \\

And I slide \\
Glide \\
Into the intersection \\
Check out my own reflection \\
When the gears grind, I won't mind

## Shower ## {#shower}

Blackest storm I ever saw \\
Was coming in from Omaha \\
And the latest news from Tokyo \\
Was a lot of ugly numbers

I was checking pay phones for forgotten coins \\
When the clouds came over West Des Moines \\
Got into the house, got the curtains drawn \\
Got into the shower with all my clothes on

Hey hey, let the water come down \\
Hey hey, let the water come down

By noon it was clear that winter'd come \\
And I just let the water run \\
I got soap suds in my eyes \\
And they stung like iodine

Phone started ringing like a fire alarm \\
And the voice on the machine was brutally calm \\
New numbers coming down the wire \\
Got out of the shower with my eyes on fire

Hey, hey, let it fall on me \\
Let it all come down relentlessly \\
You swore that you would stick around \\
When days like this started coming down \\
Well, break out the crystal \\
Get out the good champagne \\
We're going down \\
In flames

## \[Slip Away from Me\] ## {#slip}

Tapped on the window from the inside \\
Just to hear the glass ring \\
And it sang out like a shark \\
Then went silent like a tiny frightened thing

And the small sun fell down through the treetops \\
And the small sun shattered on the snow \\
And the snow stretched out like a blanket \\
Like something I used to know

I let the memory slip away from me \\
I let my memory slip away from me \\
And the snow stretched out like a shroud \\
From our doorstep to the seashore

And the new day came, whatever it intends to be \\
Let my memory be erased irretrievably \\
The rain will fall on the old house now \\
A thousand miles away

In the sky sometimes I see a reckoning \\
When I'm cold and tired \\
And then the compass tilts like a sinking ship \\
Or spins like a thing gone wild

## Something Blue ## {#blue}

You come around here when the lights are down low \\
And you hang around for six or seven hours and then you get ready to go \\
Well I remember when you used to kiss me without me asking you to \\
Yeah I remember when you used to

When I lean toward to you, you turn away \\
It's a quarter past 1 AM on a warm Saturday \\
That's all right, that's all right, I hear you \\
Don't do anything you don't wanna do \\
But I remember when you used to kiss me without me asking you to \\
Yeah I remember when you used to

## Song for Black Sabbath's Second North American Tour [^firsttour] ## {#tour}

Hang my hammer on a nail \\
Never see it again \\
Set sail for the cosmos \\
High above the world with its beaten-down men

Not long for this world \\
Have to be reminded \\
To stay away from windows \\
Not to leave important things behind

All gone \\
All gone \\
With the dawn

And then I'm in an airplane heading west \\
Over the ocean \\
Unsteady on my feet again \\
A body in motion

So far from the slaughterhouse \\
New creatures with new hearts \\
Landing at LaGuardia \\
Tearing up the charts

All gone \\
All gone \\
With the dawn

[^firsttour]:
    Occasionally called Song for Black Sabbath's First North American Tour,
    rather than Second. Rango's Ballroom, Pittsburg, February 28, 2014.

## Song for God ## {#god}

Neighbor kids running across the front yard this evening \\
Sun going down, wind gathering strength \\
The state I live in is the largest of its kind \\
It takes two days or better to walk across its length

If you try to come and find me, I will know you're coming \\
There's an old fallout shelter I can hide in \\
I won't even be able to hear their hoofbeats
When the horsemen ride in

Another mild winter, time seems to stand still \\
Sky swallows up the city like a tent \\
Young breezes' razor patterns in the dust \\
No way of saying what they're supposed to represent

I have come to where I've come to now \\
Always abiding in you \\
If you try to find me now I'll be invisible to everything \\
When the horsemen come riding on through

## Song for Greg Valentine ## {#valentine}

When they get me in a corner, break legs \\
When I feel alone and useless, break legs \\
If I can't claim the victory \\
I'm taking you down with me \\
Break legs, break legs, break legs

When your enemies are closing in, break legs \\
When they've got you under contract, break legs \\
When they're filling out your card \\
Go hard \\
Break legs, break legs, break legs

Tear my insides up \\
With over the counter stuff \\
Jump the turnbuckle and grimace \\
Try to look tough

When you get a reputation, break legs \\
Brook no insubordination, break legs \\
When the beer cups are raining down on you \\
Do what they're paying you to do \\
Break legs, break legs \\
Break legs, break legs, break legs \\
Break legs, break legs, break legs

## Song for My Stepfather ## {#stepfather}

You have got that look in your eyes \\
In the pinprick place where kindness goes to die \\
I'll be 6 years old next year \\
You erase me

You'll be sorry, you always feel sorry later on \\
When you come around to say so, I will be gone \\
And in my place, meet my letter-perfect body double \\
You erase me

And a few years later \\
I set out on my own \\
Learned to take the reins up all by myself \\
Dug the spurs in clean down to the bone

But all that comes later, now there's only you and me \\
And the replica where my body used to be \\
You can go ahead and hit him, he feels no pain at all \\
You erase me \\
You erase me

## Song for Roger Maris ## {#maris}

When the power of God shows up in your swing \\
And the people start to notice and you can't do anything about it \\
And they all come to see you \\
They start to crowd around \\
Let me tell you brother, you can feel it coming down

And I got an angel watching over me \\
A monkey on my back \\
The devil at my heels \\
Reporters breathing down my neck

Yeah, my father always told me to finish what you start \\
And my wife's about to leave me and it's going to break my heart \\
And I no longer have my youth \\
I no longer have my looks \\
I got a goddamn one-way ticket to the goddamn history books

And I got an angel watching over me \\
A monkey on my back \\
The devil at my heels \\
Reporters breathing down my neck

## Song from the Shoreline ## {#shoreline}

Through the bodies of a hundred people \\
I saw you \\
I saw you coming through the crush \\
Saw you pushing through

And in the bodies of a hundred people \\
Moving around \\
I shut my ears off to the world \\
Couldn't hear a sound \\

Among the bodies of a hundred people \\
I saw you \\
I saw you coming through the crush \\
I saw you pushing through

## Stable Boy Song ## {#stableboy}

Here come the times of changing tide \\
Here come the days of light and grace \\
Here come the hours of wordless wondrousness \\
Light, light will fill this humble place

When you come, the stars will shine brighter than spun gold \\
When you come, the world will seem shiny and new \\
My mom told me that someday someone like you would come to set things right \\
'Til you come, I'll keep this place ready for you

I saw them riding up the road \\
And I swept and scrubbed the stable twice \\
Filled it with golden yellow straw, sweet and clean \\
I did my best to make things nice

When you come, the stars will shine brighter than spun gold \\
When you come, the world will seem shiny and new \\
My mom told me that someday someone like you would come to set things right \\
Until you come, I'll keep this place ready for you

## Standard Bitter Love Song #1 ## {#sbls1}

I'm not gonna say what I came over to say to you \\
But you were thinking along the same lines \\
And you let the words come ringing through

I wouldn't've said that to you \\
I wouldn't say it if they paid me to \\
You got no manners \\
You got no manners at all \\
You got no manners \\
You got no manners \\
You got no manners at all \\
You got no manners

I'm going to try real hard \\
But I, I can't believe that you're really gonna do it \\
It's like one of those Chinese kites flying in the wind \\
And then some kid with a shotgun sends a bullet through it

And I, I came here to say it \\
But I've done that before \\
But I'd never have told you that I don't love you anymore \\
You got no manners \\
You got no manners at all \\
You got no manners \\
You got no manners \\
You got no manners at all \\
You got no manners \\
You got no manners \\
You got no manners at all \\
You got no manners

## Standard Bitter Love Song #5 ## {#sbls5}

Come down in the flatland \\
Show me your shoulder \\
Wait now where the black hand touches us  \\
We'll both grow older

And the sky above us \\
And the ground beneath us \\
And the air around us \\
And the ocean to the right

Measure your arm length \\
I can't live without it \\
I treasure those thirty inches \\
I want to talk about it

And the sky above us \\
And the ground beneath us \\
And the air around us \\
And the ocean to the right

Love you in the cold air \\
Your long hair makes me shiver \\
Above you I see the sun \\
Light up every sliver

And the sky above us \\
And the ground beneath us \\
And the air around us \\
And the ocean to the right

And the sky above us \\
And the ground beneath us \\
And the air around us \\
And the ocean to the right

## Standard Bitter Love Song #6 ## {#sbls6}

I don't like what I've turned into \\
There's a hole in my chest in the spot that you wormed out through \\
They say it's on the mend \\
But it hurts me when I bend \\
Yeah

And I saw you down at Angie's place \\
That rippling smile on your perfect face \\
Well, it really doesn't suit you \\
When I see it I want to shoot you \\
Sorry

And I don't like what you said to me \\
I don't like what you said to me \\
But I guess I'll have to deal with it \\
Just let the bullet hit me and I just reel with it \\
Isn't that right \\
Isn't that right \\
Isn't that right \\
Isn't that right

## Sure Do Love You Baby, But I Can't Do 60 No More ## {#cantdo60}

They had moved down here and you came down too \\
Where the surf's always wild and the skies are blue \\
Got my blood pressure measured down in Pahokee \\
One sixty-five over one twenty-three \\
And the lights are low over Pompano Beach tonight \\
And one light is flickering out for the last time

Coconuts growing in the coconut tree \\
Surf and turf and sand and sea \\
Down here in the wreckage, just us three \\
Him and you, you and me \\
And the lights are low over Pompano Beach tonight \\
And one light is flickering out \\
Out for the last time

## Tampa ## {#tampa}

My brother and me found out \\
Where you keep your ugly secrets hid \\
We dug up the missing one this morning \\
I don't know why you did what you did \\
Yeah, we found him naked in the snow \\
Down where the wild crocus grow \\
I don't wanna do this anymore \\
Yeah, ain't wanna fight your dirty little war

Yeah, my brother said not to waste another thin dime \\
Because he ain't comin' out next time \\
And you can soak in a bathtub full of gasoline \\
But you will never get your hands clean

Yeah, the building was glowing, fire was raging within \\
And you ran out to save your own skin \\
And I probably shouldn't blame you \\
Yeah, yeah, I probably shouldn't blame you \\
But by God, I do \\
And I found the photographs in the top dresser drawer \\
But ain't gonna fight your dirty little war \\
Hey, hey, hey \\
Yeah

## That Hippolytine Feeling ## {#hippolytine}

Sat together on the porch \\
As the sunset bled \\
And you playfully leveled your semi-automatic handgun \\
Right at my head \\
And then God \\
In another stroke of his genius \\
He opened up the floodgates \\
And the bulls came out \\
And the bulls came out

We heard the heavy hooves beating on the earth \\
As the moment came near \\
I felt the chamber of your pistol kissing my jaw \\
I felt your red lips brushing my ear \\
And then God \\
Convincing if not transparent in his motives \\
He opened up the floodgates \\
But the rivers were dry \\
'Cause it was late August \\
And the bulls came out \\
And the bulls came out

## Tribe of the Horned Heart ## {#tribe}

You knew that they were out there by the signs they'd left behind \\
On old abandoned buildings, just some Xs and some lines \\
Half-circles in the concrete, crescents in the snow \\
You could find the little beacons almost everywhere you'd go

Only people who were sick enough \\
Knew how to read them right \\
I got sick when I was seventeen \\
And I'd hunt down signs all night

You'd listen for the voices in the generator's hum \\
Hang out behind the power plant and wait for them to come \\
Hints about their mission in the rustling of the surf \\
But no secrets can be kept from you if your faith is strong enough

Only people who've been sick too long \\
Can hold on to the hope \\
That some friendly ghost is listening to the prayers they learned to say \\
At the slack end of the rope

## Tulsa Imperative ## {#tulsa}

Your momma's failed wheat field \\
Was a good place to lie down together \\
Three weeks deep into the guts of summer \\
We sweat like hogs and I felt light as a feather

I saw a disk-like object \\
Reflected in your eyes \\
And the noise grew louder \\
As we looked up to the skies

And the sleek silver body had lights along the side \\
And the sleek silver body had lights all underneath \\
I remember the warm air blowing in our faces \\
I remember the heat running through me

There was no one worth telling \\
There was nothing we could do \\
And I was real quiet as I lifted the keys from the kitchen table \\
I was looking right at you

And your hand brushed against mine \\
And it shook me inside \\
As all along the night sky \\
I watched our futures collide

And the car's new headlights cut through the darkness \\
As the oil dripped silently to the pavement underneath \\
I remember the warm air burning our faces \\
I remember the heat running through me

## Warm Lonely Planet ## {#lonelyplanet}

Let the stars come out, and the moon shine bright \\
We're sleeping on the porch tonight \\
Wind blew all the power lines down \\
Watch where you step if you go walking around

This may be the night \\
Our bodies fill with light \\
And we may hover above \\
The surface of \\
Our warm lonely planet

Let cooling rains come, let them fall \\
Let the grass grow strong and tall \\
Let the dandelions breed \\
Give me what you know I need

This may be the night \\
Our bodies fill with light \\
And we may hover above \\
The surface of \\
Our warm lonely planet

## We Shall All Be Healed [^wsabhjohn] [^wsabhalt] ## {#wsabh}

Red brick building \\
Nights that never end \\
Whole lime structure left \\
Sad games of let's pretend \\
Do our best \\
Stay true because it's what we have to do \\
We will all be healed \\
Before the night is through

Big church basement \\
Flashing lights \\
Tell me nice things \\
Hold me tight \\
But not too tight \\
Devan and Ivory \\
And Carolee and Quinn \\
We will all be healed \\
Before the sun sneaks in

[^wsabhjohn]:
    "This is a song I'll never finish writing... So I had some friends in
    Portland, and most of them are dead. And I have a lot of long stories
    about all of them, and they're the sorts of people you meet when you're
    18 or 19 who are as lost and desperate as you are, but --- and you never
    see them again after a certain point, but you carry them with you like
    little ingots resting in your heart, right. And they shine there, and
    gleam there, and hold a sort of cold fire. And the whole album, We Shall
    All Be Healed, was for them. And, I sort of, I like the idea of a hidden,
    nonexistent title track, right." Troubadour, Los Angeles, December 16,
    2011

    "I found the We Shall All Be Healed notebook... and \[it\] has a bunch of
    songs I didn't get to, and that is a song that I had written 7 or 8 times,
    and I will write some more versions of it too, and it, like, names all the
    people, who are all gone, who were sort of --- who should be credited for
    the album." --- Lawrence Arts Center, Lawrence, September 9, 2011

[^wsabhalt]:
    We Shall All Be Healed, being an unfinished song with no fixed content by
    design, has no clear lyrics. The lyrics listed here are from the earliest
    recording I'm aware of. That said, there is another version with very
    different lyrics, that is much more prominently documented in the bootleg
    record several years later, and played on piano instead of guitar:

    > Left home in a blur \\
    > Arrived in the night \\
    > Everything is going to be all right \\
    > Came back to the place \\
    > Where it all flared out \\
    > Just to check if the reservoir \\
    > Still bore the mark of the drought
    > 
    > Up to 13th and Taylor, check my pulse \\
    > You weren't there, and neither was anybody else \\
    > Stared down demons, came back breathing \\
    > No real point in ever leaving \\
    > Tracy and Ivory and Brad and me too \\
    > We will see some great miracle before the night is through
    > 
    > Slipped in through the entrance \\
    > Stood in the hall \\
    > Left my fingerprints on the elevator wall \\
    > Went down to my old room \\
    > Stood outside it a minute \\
    > Wondering if parts of me \\
    > Were still there in it
    > 
    > Who can say it won't be me \\
    > You are gone now and I am free \\
    > Wesley and Quinn and Devan and you \\
    > We will all be fixed up as good as new 
    > 
    > And I stared at the number 10 on my old apartment's door \\
    > That's one ghost that can't bite me anymore \\
    > And someday we will all feel at home in our new skin \\
    > And someday we will never be alone again \\
    > When the sun comes up and the night has passed \\
    > We shall all be healed at last, at last, at last, at last

## \[Whon\] ## {#whon}

The garbage man is never going to come \\
The cans out at the curb will bloat and stink \\
The rot will work its way through cracks in the foundation \\
The water will go stagnant in the sink \\
And you, you will know \\
Where it is that memories go

The migratory birds will not come back \\
The charms that summer held will all turn sour \\
And from the treetops when the wind stops \\
Sweet blossoms will rain down and you will stand beneath the shower \\
And it will be so clear \\
You will never quite escape last year

The wind will blow or else it won't \\
Sometimes you just move on and sometimes you just don't \\
You think the matter through, you try hard not to think \\
The water all goes stagnant in the kitchen sink \\
And you will know, and I will too \\
What it was I might have left to you

## Wishing the House Would Crash ## {#crash}

I was standing outside \\
With my hands in the air \\
And the scent of gardenias \\
Was everywhere \\
Let the house come down on me \\
Let the house come down on you

I made my invocation \\
With my eyes on fire \\
You were there at the window \\
You are a goddamn liar \\
Let the house come down on me \\
Let the house come down on you

## Wizard Level ## {#wizardlevel}

Wake up and recite the lost formula \\
Scrub my face with cold water at the basin \\
Sketch forgotten trees inside a little notebook \\
Commit their names to memory \\
Trying to get up \\
Trying to get up to wizard level \\
Trying to get up \\
Trying to get up to wizard level

Go walking out behind the house by moonlight \\
Collect dry stems and leaves and small green pinecones \\
In a muslin bag I got down at the hardware store \\
Blessings on the hardware store \\
Trying to get up \\
Trying to get up to wizard level \\
Just trying to get up \\
Trying to get up to wizard level

Not everybody gets there \\
Very few can find the path \\
Go to sleep and dream these holy dreams \\
Scatter to the wind each day at sunrise \\
Always catch the sunrise when I can \\
Held in my heart through trying times \\
Trying to get up \\
Trying to get up to wizard level \\
Just trying to get up \\
Trying to get up to wizard level

## You Were Cool ## {#cool}

This is a song with the same four chords I use most of the time \\
When I've got something on my mind \\
And I don't want to squander the moment \\
Trying to come up with a better[^morecomplicated] way \\
To say what I want to say

People were mean to you \\
But I always thought you were cool \\
Clicking down the concrete hallways \\
In your spiked heels \\
Back in high school

It's good to be young, but let's not kid ourselves \\
It's better to pass on through those years and come out the other side \\
With our hearts still beating \\
Having stared down demons and come back breathing

People were mean to you \\
But I always thought you were cool \\
Clicking down the concrete hallways \\
In your spiked heels \\
Back in high school

You deserved better than you got \\
Someone's got to say it sometime cause it's true \\
People should have told you you were awesome \\
Instead of taking advantage of you

I hope you love your life now \\
Like I love mine \\
I hope the painful memories only flex their power over you \\
A little of the time

We held on to hope of better days coming \\
And when we did we were right \\
I hope the people who did you wrong \\
Have trouble sleeping at night

People were mean to you \\
But I always thought you were cool \\
Clicking down the concrete hallways \\
In your spiked heels \\
Back in high school

Yeah, yeah

## You're in Maya [^mayatitle] [^mayajohn] ## {#maya}

He hit me right in the face \\
I drove the Falcon [^falcon] uptown \\
Hung out in the library parking lot \\
The swelling will never go down

Pint of Hiram Walker [^hiramwalker] in the lining \\
Of my father's old corduroy coat \\
Big, big plans hatching in my brain \\
And a big ugly lump in my throat

I drove up to Harvey Mudd [^harveymudd] and I played pinball \\
'Til I didn't want to kill anyone \\
Polished off all my cheap whiskey \\
And stepped out into the California sun

Singing bainne na mbó is na gamhna \\
And the juice of the barley for me \\
Singing bainne na mbó is na gamhna \\
And the juice of the barley for me [^mayachorus]

My thirst carried me up the coast \\
Where it only got sharper, goddammit \\
In a small room that got even smaller \\
A block away from the Willamette [^willamette]

There was nowhere I needed to go \\
And nowhere I wanted to be \\
And my window looked out upon nothing \\
And nothing looked right back at me [^nietzsche]

I had a couple of things on my mind \\
A couple of problems to think through \\
And I drank 'til I couldn't see straight anymore \\
Until there was nothing to drink to

Singing bainne na mbó is na gamhna \\
And the juice of the barley for me \\
Singing bainne na mbó is na gamhna \\
And the juice of the barley for me

[^mayatitle]:
    "It's called 'You're in Maya', which is a thing that the Hare Krishnas say
    to one another when they're saying that you're too caught up in thoughts
    of the world, right. 'Maya' is the energy that constrains us all here and
    keeps our mind on material things." --- Bottom of the Hill, San
    Francisco, California, October 23, 2002. See also Crossing Border,

    "This is a song that is extensively autobiographical. It is probably the
    only one in my whole corpus like that." --- Crossing Borders, Amsterdam,
