## Saigon Shrunken Panorama ## {#panorama}

The last vestiges of empire were crumbling \\
Daisies were pushing through the ground \\
And I saw a crane disappear beneath still water \\
On the day when you came back around \\
And though time remembers meaningless gestures \\
Your goodness will not be forgotten while I am still alive \\
It was the eighteenth day of May in 1975 [^may1975]

And I asked if you could last a week or two \\
And you said you thought you could \\
You came inside then with the light trickling behind you \\
It was fine and it was good \\
And so gleams the single moment \\
Before we heard the officers arrive \\
On the eighteenth day of May in 1975

Hey

[^may1975]:
    This date is shortly after the [Fall (or Liberation, depending on your
    point of view) of Saigon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Saigon) at
    the end of the Vietnam War on April 30, 1975.

## Song for My Stepfather ## {#stepfather}

You have got that look in your eyes \\
In the pinprick place where kindness goes to die \\
I'll be 6 years old next year \\
You erase me

You'll be sorry, you always feel sorry later on \\
When you come around to say so, I will be gone \\
And in my place, meet my letter-perfect body double \\
You erase me

And a few years later \\
I set out on my own \\
Learned to take the reins up all by myself \\
Dug the spurs in clean down to the bone

But all that comes later, now there's only you and me \\
And the replica where my body used to be \\
You can go ahead and hit him, he feels no pain at all \\
You erase me \\
You erase me

## Stable Boy Song ## {#stableboy}

Here come the times of changing tide \\
Here come the days of light and grace \\
Here come the hours of wordless wondrousness \\
Light, light will fill this humble place

When you come, the stars will shine brighter than spun gold \\
When you come, the world will seem shiny and new \\
My mom told me that someday someone like you would come to set things right \\
'Til you come, I'll keep this place ready for you

I saw them riding up the road \\
And I swept and scrubbed the stable twice \\
Filled it with golden yellow straw, sweet and clean \\
I did my best to make things nice

When you come, the stars will shine brighter than spun gold \\
When you come, the world will seem shiny and new \\
My mom told me that someday someone like you would come to set things right \\
Until you come, I'll keep this place ready for you

## Tulsa Imperative ## {#tulsa}

Your momma's failed wheat field \\
Was a good place to lie down together \\
Three weeks deep into the guts of summer \\
We sweat like hogs and I felt light as a feather

I saw a disk-like object \\
Reflected in your eyes \\
And the noise grew louder \\
As we looked up to the skies

And the sleek silver body had lights along the side \\
And the sleek silver body had lights all underneath \\
I remember the warm air blowing in our faces \\
I remember the heat running through me

There was no one worth telling \\
There was nothing we could do \\
And I was real quiet as I lifted the keys from the kitchen table \\
I was looking right at you

And your hand brushed against mine \\
And it shook me inside \\
As all along the night sky \\
I watched our futures collide

And the car's new headlights cut through the darkness \\
As the oil dripped silently to the pavement underneath \\
I remember the warm air burning our faces \\
I remember the heat running through me

## Wizard Level ## {#wizardlevel}

Wake up and recite the lost formula \\
Scrub my face with cold water at the basin \\
Sketch forgotten trees inside a little notebook \\
Commit their names to memory \\
Trying to get up \\
Trying to get up to wizard level \\
Trying to get up \\
Trying to get up to wizard level

Go walking out behind the house by moonlight \\
Collect dry stems and leaves and small green pinecones \\
In a muslin bag I got down at the hardware store \\
Blessings on the hardware store \\
Trying to get up \\
Trying to get up to wizard level \\
Just trying to get up \\
Trying to get up to wizard level

Not everybody gets there \\
Very few can find the path \\
Go to sleep and dream these holy dreams \\
Scatter to the wind each day at sunrise \\
Always catch the sunrise when I can \\
Held in my heart through trying times \\
Trying to get up \\
Trying to get up to wizard level \\
Just trying to get up \\
Trying to get up to wizard level

## You Were Cool ## {#cool}

This is a song with the same four chords I use most of the time \\
When I've got something on my mind \\
And I don't want to squander the moment \\
Trying to come up with a better[^morecomplicated] way \\
To say what I want to say

People were mean to you \\
But I always thought you were cool \\
Clicking down the concrete hallways \\
In your spiked heels \\
Back in high school

It's good to be young, but let's not kid ourselves \\
It's better to pass on through those years and come out the other side \\
With our hearts still beating \\
Having stared down demons and come back breathing

People were mean to you \\
But I always thought you were cool \\
Clicking down the concrete hallways \\
In your spiked heels \\
Back in high school

You deserved better than you got \\
Someone's got to say it sometime cause it's true \\
People should have told you you were awesome \\
Instead of taking advantage of you

I hope you love your life now \\
Like I love mine \\
I hope the painful memories only flex their power over you \\
A little of the time

We held on to hope of better days coming \\
And when we did we were right \\
I hope the people who did you wrong \\
Have trouble sleeping at night

People were mean to you \\
But I always thought you were cool \\
Clicking down the concrete hallways \\
In your spiked heels \\
Back in high school

Yeah, yeah

## You're in Maya [^mayatitle] [^mayajohn] ## {#maya}

He hit me right in the face \\
I drove the Falcon [^falcon] uptown \\
Hung out in the library parking lot \\
The swelling will never go down

Pint of Hiram Walker [^hiramwalker] in the lining \\
Of my father's old corduroy coat \\
Big, big plans hatching in my brain \\
And a big ugly lump in my throat

I drove up to Harvey Mudd [^harveymudd] and I played pinball \\
'Til I didn't want to kill anyone \\
Polished off all my cheap whiskey \\
And stepped out into the California sun

Singing bainne na mbó is na gamhna \\
And the juice of the barley for me \\
Singing bainne na mbó is na gamhna \\
And the juice of the barley for me [^mayachorus]

My thirst carried me up the coast \\
Where it only got sharper, goddammit \\
In a small room that got even smaller \\
A block away from the Willamette [^willamette]

There was nowhere I needed to go \\
And nowhere I wanted to be \\
And my window looked out upon nothing \\
And nothing looked right back at me [^nietzsche]

I had a couple of things on my mind \\
A couple of problems to think through \\
And I drank 'til I couldn't see straight anymore \\
Until there was nothing to drink to

Singing bainne na mbó is na gamhna \\
And the juice of the barley for me \\
Singing bainne na mbó is na gamhna \\
And the juice of the barley for me

[^mayatitle]:
    "It's called 'You're in Maya', which is a thing that the Hare Krishnas say
    to one another when they're saying that you're too caught up in thoughts
    of the world, right. 'Maya' is the energy that constrains us all here and
    keeps our mind on material things." --- Bottom of the Hill, San
    Francisco, California, October 23, 2002. See also Crossing Border,
    Amsterdam, October 9, 1999

[^mayajohn]:
    "This is a song that is extensively autobiographical. It is probably the
    only one in my whole corpus like that." --- Crossing Borders, Amsterdam,
    October 9, 1999

    Although this may have been semi-true at the time, it has long since
    ceased to be so.

[^falcon]:
    The [Ford
    Falcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Falcon_(North_America)) is a
    classic American compact car produced from the 1960s through the 1970s.

[^hiramwalker]:
    [Hiram Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Club) is a whiskey
    distillery and brand.

[^harveymudd]:
    [Harvey Mudd College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Mudd_College)
    is one of the Claremont Colleges in Claremont, California. John attended
    Pitzer, one of the other 4 undergraduate colleges in the consortium.

[^mayachorus]:
    "The chorus is in Irish Gaelic, and I pronounce it badly, probably. It's
    'bainne na mbó is na gamnha', which means the 'the milk of the cow is
    all right for the calf'." Bottom of the Hill, San Francisco, California,
    October 23, 2002.

[^willamette]:
    The [Willamette River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willamette_River)
    passes through Portland, Oregon.

[^nietzsche]:
    Likely a reference to German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's famous
    quote, 'He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby
    become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also
    gaze into thee.'

    Evil](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4363). Aphorism 146. Archived by
