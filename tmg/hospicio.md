Released: 2005 \\
Label: None, online release

[^hospicio]:
    In Spanish, "Hospicio de Huérfanos" translates to "Hospice for Orphans" or
    "Orphanage" (the accent was left out of John's metadata). Many
    organizations with similar names exist.

### Release notes ### {#notes}

Released online for Christmas 2005 by John in response to Vanderslice's
release of a live show for the holidays. [^post] The title, Hospicio de
Huerfanos, comes from the metadata in both mp3s. Both songs are outtakes from
earlier albums and therefore likely precede the 2005 release date.

    John writes:

    My boy JV is offering a live show for free download, and how can a fellow
    traveller not feel moved by such holiday cheer? Here are two songs from
    the vaults; a live recording of the first has been circulating for a
    while, but I don't think anybody's ever heard the other. Neither of them
    are particularly festive, unless you favor a certain kind of party, in
    which case, God bless us every one. They're both favorites of mine;
    "Deserters," technically a "demo" though the word has always given me
    fits, is the song that sparked the We Shall All Be Healed album, and has a
    number of images that are sort of touchstones for me. Both work best if
    you play 'em real loud.

    Cut Off Their Thumbs \\
    Deserters

    So there you go - yuletide greetings to all; I hope this small gift in
    some way indicates how happy you've all made me this year, and I'll see
    you in the spring!

## Cut Off Their Thumbs \#1 [^thumbsjohn] [^thumbsseries] [^thumbsouttake] [^adonibezek] ## {#thumbs}

We sprawl out on the bed \\
Or we lean against the wall \\
Down amongst the dregs \\
Where the yellow spiders crawl \\
The telephone is broken \\
And the drapes have all been closed \\
Hands up who doesn't know exactly \\
Where this story goes

I'm gonna kill everybody in this room \\
I'm gonna kill everybody in this room

How has it come to this \\
Well, I haven't got a clue \\
You looking up at me \\
And us two glowering down at you \\
Wind shakes the palm trees \\
With an escalating fury \\
Face the judge \\
Or take your chances with the jury

I'm gonna kill everybody in this room \\
I'm gonna kill everybody in this room

Let's have a little music \\
On this hazy afternoon \\
Let's hope the tension in here \\
Finds its resolution soon \\
Radio on the window sill \\
Old white moon above \\
God watches over children \\
And he cares for fools in love [^fools]

I'm gonna kill everybody in this room \\
I'm gonna kill everybody in this room

    "Sometimes you write things, and you say --- oh, what's that, there's a,
    in Fight Club... when Ed Norton during his first time beating somebody up
    --- really just beats somebody up very, very badly, just makes him
    unrecognizably ugly...  he finishes this horrible beating and his friend
    (who is in fact himself) says, 'Whoa, where'd you go, buddy?' That's sort
    of what I said to myself after I wrote this song called Cut Off Their
    Thumbs." --- Kaufman Center Ecstatic Music Fest, New York, March 24, 2012

    "It's a love song, of sorts." --- Go! Rehearsal Studios, Room 4, Carrboro,

    In a review of ten songs on Last Plane to Jakarta, John includes Cut Off
    Your Thumbs #1 as song eight, writing, "I try to avoid talking about my
    own stuff on Last Plane to Jakarta but I am in a bad mood tonight, and
    this song, a new one in which more blood gets shed than in any preceding
    Mountain Goats song, suits the general timbre of my day. It is unpleasant
    and mean-spirited. It makes me feel bad about myself in all the right
    ways. I apologize for even bringing it up."

[^thumbsouttake]:
    Cut Off Your Thumbs #1 was originally intended to be part of the [Bedside

[^adonibezek]:
    Plausibly a reference to Judges 1:7 -- 8, which describes the defeat of
    the Caananite king Adoni-Bezek by the Israelites: "When Adoni-bezek fled,
    they pursued him, seized him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
    Adoni-bezek said, 'Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off
    used to pick up scraps under my table. God has repaid me for what I have
    done.' They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there." [Judges 1:7 --
    8](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%201:6%20-%207&version=HCSB),
    Holman Christian Standard Bible, retrieved December 6, 2013.

[^fools]:
    From an often-modified saying that God watches over children and fools,
    made more famous in the form, "God watches over fools, children, and
    Americans", frequently misattributed to Otto von Bismarck and perhaps
    actually being popularized by José Correia da Serra. Multiple
    versions predate or correspond with Bismarck, for example, in the Editor's
    Drawer of Harper's New Monthly Magazine, Volume 14, 1857, Mary Russell
    Mitford's 1830 Stories of American Life, or even earlier, in French,
    Queen Marguerite's 1708 Contes et Nouvelles.

*"Two, three, four."*

The neighbors are cloning themselves \\
I found their cocoons in the garbage \\
And we'll either stay high forever or crash \\
In and out or two \\
Sleeping the sleep of the blessed \\
Picking through trash cans with you

The guy on TV is a prophet \\
You just have to look in his eyes \\
And we'll either turn our lives over to Christ \\
Or we'll just drift off \\
Trying to better ourselves \\
Giving up after one or two tries

The high school's a front for Yakuza [^yakuza] \\
Everyone, everyone knows it \\
And we will all shortly be richer than God \\
If we'll just hold on \\
As long as we play all our cards right \\
As long as nobody here blows it \\
I've drawn up a map of Rialto [^rialto] \\
The holding tanks full for the night \\
I heard all about it on Citizens' Band [^cb] \\
It's a brand new day \\
We'll be awake until Thursday \\
The future's disarmingly bright
