[^cover]:
    As with Come, Come to the Sunset Tree and several other albums, All
    Survivors Pack had multiple different covers. The cover depicted here is
    one of the two owned by Caliclimber ([see above](#credits)), but many
    others exist. The liner notes are the same, but the art painted on each
    album differs.

### Lyrics only --- sorry! ###

## Catherine Antrim's Kid ## {#antrim}

*"Two, three, and."*

Brush all the dust of Kansas \\
Off of my special shoes \\
When the coach lets us out at the corner store \\
Mom was coughing like an old man, shivering like a cold man

And I found some trouble to get into \\
The admiration was mutual \\
Split my winnings with mom 55/45 \\
But it didn't keep her alive

I got lost out there in New Mexico \\
Nothing to lose, nowhere to go \\
I got lost when my lucky stars crossed

That night I dreamt about Fort Stanton \\
Though I didn't know to call it that yet \\
And the night wrapped me up in its long dark embrace \\
I had that same expression on as that one picture of my face

Which was all anyone would ever know about me \\
After my visitors got done with me \\
I lay down singing on the porch, blood streaming from my mouth \\
Sounded kind of like Paul Westerberg but to tell you the truth

I got lost out there in New Mexico \\
Nothing to lose, nowhere to go \\
I got lost when my lucky stars crossed

## Rotten Stinking Mouthpiece ## {#mouthpiece}

*"One, two, three, and."*

Lob some spit at the window \\
Watch it run down the pane \\
It's only the guilty who concern themselves \\
With clearing their names

You bring tidings of hope, false tidings \\
When you come here \\
There's two friends who did me wrong that you're protecting \\
It's so clear

When you speak, it's those two who speak through you \\
Who'll speak for me? \\
The burning and the electricity

Sun goes down, San Francisco
Friends are hard to find \\
Chew them up just as quick as I can find them \\
Try to clear my mind

Remember hours at the table \\
Gauze-white light, easing through \\
If there's one thing that I'm not going to do tonight \\
It's die for you

'Cause when you speak, it's those two who speak through you \\
Who'll speak for me? \\
The burning and the electricity
