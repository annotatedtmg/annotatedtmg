[^taboojohn]:
    "In 1992 my friend Dennis Callaci ran a label called Shrimper, and I had
    been starting to turn my poems into songs and I thought some of them were
    pretty good, so I put nine of them on a tape --- eight or nine of them on
    a tape, and I gave it to Dennis, 'cause he had asked, 'Could I hear
    something?' And the next time I saw him, they had a cover that I had --- I
    had drawn a little fake cover, you know, why wouldn't you do that, you can
    draw a little picture of a goat and like a brick wall behind him or
    something, you know and then write some fake liner notes on a typewriter,
    and give it to Dennis. And the next time I saw it, it was twenty copies of
    it that he had printed up, and he gave it back to me. And he had added a
    couple songs. I do not consider them part of the album. They were --- it's
    very clear from the liner notes. That's how it came to pass that my first
    tape had bonus tracks." Bottom of the Hill, San Francisco, June 15, 2014

    "When I wrote and recorded Taboo VI, I had no idea that anyone outside of
    a few friends would ever hear it; neither did I hope that anyone outside
    of those friends would ever express any interest in it. A couple of the
    things on it (Going to Alaska, Eleven Bands, Solomon Revisited, the Hank
    Williams song) are things I'd stand by if pressed, though I wish I'd've
    known how to sing better back when they were recorded. While I completely
    understand the collector's urge, I would offer the following caveat to
    anyone trying to hunt down Taboo VI: it's not what you think it is. Its
    successor, the Hound Chronicles, represented an abrupt and total change in
    direction, and is the stylistic starting point for all that followed.
    While I can't and wouldn't disown Taboo VI, I'd like to offer this note of
    caution to those who like the later stuff and are trying to get their
    hands on my first efforts: you probably won't like it much, and if you pay
    an inflated price for it, you'll probably feel cheated. Having said that,
    if you still feel inclined to hunt it down, I do hope that you enjoy it on
    its own meager terms. It means well and didn't want to hurt anyone. Except
    for maybe that one guy. I hate that guy." [Comment from John Darnielle on
    Taboo VI: The
    Homecoming](http://www.themountaingoats.net/misc/taboo_comments.txt), May
    29, 1997

    "Tantric lo-fi by a not-so-lapsed Catholic. A suburban Chris Knox. A
    bottled Barrell, a patchwork of songs lost and found." Catalog description
    on insert in the [Back to the Egg, Asshole](ghana.html#related) Shrimper
    compilation.

    "If I ever reissue that thing, you'll know that I, like, need a new kidney
    or something." Zoop, Farm Sanctuary, New York, June 17, 2007

    "If you never hear that tape, it'll be better for you." Brownie's, New
    York, April 12, 1998

    "'Leave the dead to bury their dead,' as Christ put it \-\- the world is a
    better place without *Taboo VI* fouling its already-polluted air." [Heavy

    Goats](http://www.spacecityrock.com/issue4/mountaingoats1.html), Space
    City Rock, Spring 2001

    "Good, good, good, good, good. No one should own that. It's not very
    good." KJHK interview, March 2, 1997. In this same interview, John claimed
    that he was working on a sequel to Taboo VI which would "answer any
    questions raised by the predecessor", which hasn't surfaced.

[^tabootitle]:
    I'm not sure what the origin of the title is --- if you do, please [email
    me](../about.html#contact). *Taboo* is a [pornographic film
    series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo_(film_series)) which runs from
    *Taboo* through *Taboo 23* as of 2015, and Taboos 3 through 7 had titles
    which are very similar to the title of this album. Specifically:

    * Taboo 3: The Final Chapter
    * Taboo 4: The Younger Generation
    * Taboo 5: The Secret
    * Taboo 6: The Obsession
    * Taboo 7: The Wild And The Innocent

    These were released between 1984 and 1989, early enough that John could
    have based the album title off of them. Given the sexual theme of other
    aspects of the album, this seems reasonable to me.

[^1992]:
    Although the Mountain Goats website lists the release as 1991, the insert
    lists the release as 1992. Further, Tim Adams from Ajax and Three Beads of
    Sweat (and who also put together the discography that formed the basis of
    what eventually was listed on the Mountain Goats website) confirms this
    release chronology:

    > I got a lot of my "release dates" from looking back at when I received
    > stock at Ajax -- not a perfect method, but close enough. Anyway, my
    > comments:

    > 1992  \\
    > -Taboo VI* -- I first stocked this in May '92, but may have originally
    > come out in '91. (I believe that May '92 was the first time I had dealt
    > with Shrimper catalog)  \\
    > -Hound Chronicles* -- first stocked August '92  \\
    > -Songs for Petronius* -- first stocked January '93 \\
    > 1993  \\
    > -Transmissions to Horace (?) \[I'm leaning toward this one\] -- first
    > stocked July '93  \\
    > -Chile de Arbol* -- I put this out, so I know the release date was 6/28/93 \\
    > -Hot Garden Stomp* -- first stocked October '93 \\
    > -Philyra* (Cusp of 94?) -- first stocked Feb. '94 \\
    > 1994 \\
    > -Things Get Confusing \\
    > In some order: \\
    > -Beautiful Rat Sunset* (I suspect this is early b/c it was recorded Summer
    > 93 but vinyl manufacturing takes a while) -- first stocked Feb. '94 Why
    > You All? (I have no idea) -- first stocked July '94

{:. start="9"}

Track 10 is a joint recording by the Mountain Goats + The Congress. Track 9 is
track 9.

Mahayana [^mahayana]

Is it possible for animals to be reborn as deities? [^joshusdog]

[^bonus]:
    As John [explains above](#fn:taboojohn), Dennis Callaci added the
    recordings of I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry and Eleven Bands to the eight
    songs that John had given to him and therefore never considered them to be
    part of the album. This was additionally emphasized when John played the
    whole tape live at the Bottom of the Hill as part of the Twin Inhuman
    Highway Fiends tour in 2014 with Peter Hughes, as he concluded the tape
    with Going to Alaska.

    Bottom of the Hill, San Francisco, June 15, 2014. See also Zoop, Farm
    Sanctuary, New York, June 17, 2007.

[^mahayana]:
    [Mahayana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana) is a major school of
    Buddhist thought, with the majority of the world's Buddhists falling under
    its traditions as of 2015. Contrasted primarily with Theravada, the
    Mahayana (or "great vehicle") places as the purpose of Buddhist practice
    not just transcendence of samsara and attainment of Buddhahood, but
    becoming a bodhisattva, a Buddha who practices to help all sentient beings
    attain enlightenment.

[^joshusdog]:
    This question is most similar to the famous Zen koan, [Joshu's
    dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gateless_Gate#Case_1:_Joshu.27s_Dog),
    one of the koans in the 13th century Zen text The Gateless Gate, compiled
    by the Chinese master Wumen Huikai:

    > A monk asked Zhaozhou, "Does a dog have Buddha-nature or not?" \\
    > Zhaozhou replied, "Mu."

    The koan includes the answer "mu", meaning "nothing" or "nonexistence".
    The purpose of the koan is to impress upon the student that Buddha-nature
    should be realized through practice rather than through memorization of
    dogma. As the Gateless Gate continues:

    > Has a dog Buddha-nature? \\
    > This is the most serious question of all. \\
    > If you say yes or no, \\
    > You lose your own Buddha-nature.

## Running Away with What Freud Said [^freudjohn] [^freud] ## {#freud}

*"しあわせを \\
祈る女の　性かなし \\
辛や　重たや　わが恋ながら \\
沖の瀬をゆく　底曳き網の \\
舟にのせたい..."* [^misorahibari]

Big city, wide corner \\
New flowers,[^morning] cold comfort \\
56 Fahrenheit early in the morning \\
Buses passing by, black smoke in their wake \\
Big surprises, a lot of big surprises \\
Bones ringing, running away with what Freud said [^freud]

Same [^new] morning, world breathing \\
Far, far from home \\
Big ringing in the bones \\
Whose bones are these --- God please \\
Feel the pumping, feel the fresh blood pump inside \\
City's living,[^portland] the city's truly living \\
What's the difference, running away with what Freud said

[^freudjohn]:
    "It's a cryptic little song that seems not to actually be about anything.
    But it's about --- it's like one of the first four or five Mountain Goats
    song ever written, I didn't really know what I was doing, that's kind of
    the charm of that first cassette, if it has a charm to speak of...  So the
    song is about how I had this real bad blackout when I lived in Portland, I
    was kind of a mess up there. And I had this blackout where when I came to
    I didn't know what day it was and I think I had been out for four or five
    days, but I had in my mind that I had been out for longer than that. So I
    elected to stay in the house longer until I could figure out what day it
    was. This was not really too bright, but, so, but I was there for a couple
    more days, you know, convinced that I didn't have, I was pretty crazy, and
    you know, and finally I was like, 'Oh, fuck it, I'm going outside.' And I
    combed my hair and I put on my hat and my sunglasses with\[out\] which I
    did not leave the house, and I walked outside and it wasn't cold anymore,
    as it had been when I had blacked out. And I looked around, and they'd put
    flowers in the planters in downtown Portland. I was like, it was like the
    whole world was transformed, and it wasn't my body anymore, because, and
    that's what the line, 'whose bones are these' is in that song, is because
    my hip was clicking. It clicked for another 2 years, the hip. That's the
    end of that story." Bottom of the Hill, San Francisco, June 13, 2006.

[^freud]:
    [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) was a 19th --
    20th century Austrian neurologist who founded psychoanalysis, a theory of
    psychology which postulated that suppressed urges from forgotten childhood
    events determine much of human behavior. His tremendous influence on
    psychology lives on today even though many of this theories were
    ultimately proven false.

[^misorahibari]:
    This is from Midare Gami by the famous Japanese singer [Hibari
    Misora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibari_Misora). The song takes its
    title from [Midaregami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midaregami), which
    means "tangled hair", itself a collection of short poems (called a tanka)
    written by Akiko Yosano in 1901 depicting the sexual awakening of a young
    Japanese woman. Transliterated into rōmaji, this reads:

    > ... \[shiaw\]ase o \\
    > Inoru on-na no saga kanashi \\
    > Tsura ya omota ya waga koi nagara \\
    > Oki no se o yuku sokobiki ami no \\
    > Fune ni nosetai...

    This is from the second stanza of the song. In full, the song goes:

    > 髪の乱れに　手をやれば (Kami no midare ni te o yareba) \\
    > 赤い蹴出しが　風に舞う (Akai kedashi ga kaze ni mau) \\
    > 憎や　恋しや　塩屋の岬  (Niku ya koishi ya Shioya no misaki) \\
    > 投げて届かぬ　想いの糸が (Nagete todokanu omoi no ito ga) \\
    > 胸にからんで　涙をしぼる (Mune ni karande namida wo shiboru)
    >
    > すてたお方の　しあわせを (Suteta okata no shiawase o) \\
    > 祈る女の　性かなし (Inoru on-na no saga kanashi) \\
    > 辛や　重たや　わが恋ながら (Tsura ya omota ya waga koi nagara) \\
    > 沖の瀬をゆく　底曳き網の (Oki no se o yuku sokobiki ami no) \\
    > 舟にのせたい　この片情け (Fune ni nosetai kono kata nasake)
    >
    > 春は二重に　巻いた帯 (Haru ha futae ni maita obi) \\
    > 三重に巻いても　余る秋 (Mie ni maitemo amaru aki) \\
    > 暗や　涯てなや　塩屋の岬 (Kura ya hate na ya Shioya no misaki) \\
    > 見えぬ心を　照らしておくれ (Mienu kokoro o terashite okure) \\
    > ひとりぽっちに しないでおくれ (Hitori pocchi ni shinaide okure)

    This translates to:

    > When I extended my hand over the tangling hair \\
    > The bright red slip of kimono fled up in the air \\
    > Bearing hate and longing at the same time, at Shioya am I now \\
    > The mental threads of my heart can't reach him by any means \\
    > The threads left in my mind will cause me to shed tears
    >
    > A woman wishes happiness for the man who dumped her \\
    > I feel her woman-nature, rather too sad \\
    > Bearing pain and heaviness, this is, though, my love \\
    > I wish I could ask the trawling ship on the sea \\
    > To load up and carry away this, my one way love
    >
    > In spring this belt was fastened in two turns \\
    > In autumn, surprisingly, it goes, more than three \\
    > Bearing gloom and no ending at Shioya am I now \\
    > I wish his heart could be lit up by the lighthouse \\
    > His image is always on my mind; so don't leave me alone

    translation for additional details on the translation.

## Ice Cream, Cobra Man [^cobrajohn] ## {#cobra}

*"I think a lot of women aren't willing to perform analingus immediately, they
have to be sort of told or invited to it. I think they neglect it as being a
erogenous zone on a man. I enjoy having my asshole licked during a 69 position
while I am devouring her myself."* [^analingus]

I have a hand disfigured by snakebite \\
I have a couple of things that I really like \\
And I am heading your way all the time

I'm gonna move all my vital organs \\
To someplace outside my body \\

I feel no pain \\
As I float across your ceiling \\
And I, I have no shame \\
I am in a thousand rooms all at the same time \\
Yeah, and I have a glass \\
Filled with water and light and I feel good tonight \\
I am climbing up this mountain \\
You can watch me \\
You can watch me

*"Um, I just enjoy it very wet, and I --- just knowing that the woman --- and
just imagining what she looks like with her tongue out licking me and at the
same time feeling that sensation is just tremendously hot for me."*

There's nothing you can do,[^isthere] would it leave a single trace \\
Will it take your pretty features and lay them all to waste \\
Can we sit down over there, can we sit down any place \\
Can you feel the spirit moving, can you feel God's grace \\

Ever since I married you I've wondered what it means \\
That every single shirt I own is burst out at the seams \\
Every single piece of clothing,[^sneakers] every last pair of jeans \\

And I'm sure that there's a reason all of this is happening \\

    "This is the first of the Alpha songs, which was the project that gave
    birth to the Mountain Goats. I was writing these poems called 'Songs from
    Point Alpha Privative' and, but I was discovering with poems, nobody
    wanted to read any poems. If you show up with your poems, people like,
    they're busy, they have a thing to do. But if you're writing poems
    probably you're like, 'No, I would like some attention for these poems,
    that's why I write them, because they need attention.' So I started
    setting them to music. And then they seemed less offensive then to people.
    So that's where they went. And this was --- and then also it opens you up
    to using a lot more rhyme, because rhyme on the page, people, the people
    who do want to read poetry don't want to read the stuff that rhymes,
    whereas the people who listen to songs, which are better than poems, are
    totally into rhymes. So anyway, so this song is a repeating AAAA rhyme
    scheme through three stanzas." Bottom of the Hill, San Francisco, June 15,

    because I was writing so many songs at the time that I needed to keep
    track of which ones were in the series so I'd know, and that was a nice
    signal, the Alpha in the title, that it was about this couple. It stemmed
    originally from a misunderstanding of the term 'alpha privative' which is
    the 'a' in front of a word that negates: moral, amoral, right. In Latin
    that's called alpha privative. When I first learned that I was like twenty
    and I was like, 'Awesome, the letter that negates!', you know. A couple
    years later I was talking to my Latin teacher about it and he was like,
    'Yeah, it just doesn't carry that kind of force, nobody thinks of the term
    alpha privative as something you know, annihilating stuff.' But I did. So
    I called the set Songs from Point Alpha Privative. And, so I started
    writing these Alpha songs to look at, to try and inhabit the divorcing
    mindset a little bit, maybe to come to grips with the fact that my parents
    divorced, and to see what thoughts and feelings I had about all that. And
    then as time passed the characters got more blood and bone on them and I
    just sort of would play with them, torture them." VPRO session, Zeldzaam
    Dwars, March 27, 2004

    As John says above, an [a
    privative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privative_a), or α privative, is
    exactly what he explains it is: the prefix a- or an- which denotes the
    opposite of the root word. It is used in Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, and many
    modern languages.

    The lyrics of the second verse, particularly the second and third lines,
    and parts of the third verse are extremely muffled and maybe not even
    preserved on the studio recording. These lyrics have been reconstructed
    both from the original recording on Taboo VI and from the only known
    studio recording at the Bottom of the Hill, San Francisco, June 15, 2014.
    Where any disparity exists, I've transcribed the lyrics of the original.

    Notably I disagree with Nall about the first line of the second verse,
    which he transcribes as "What the hell's going on at the end of the
    debate". After listening closely to the original and the live version I'm
    confident that this is instead as I've transcribed.

    The live recording switches in a number of places 'we' for 'you' but is
    otherwise structurally similar, except as noted.

    this song, and everybody there would sing."

    John: "'Cause I knew it would kill. I knew they would all love me once
    they heard about this song... What it lacks in subtlety, it makes up for
    in radio."

    "This was the last song --- except that then Dennis put another song, he
    thought, two songs he thought was good on the tape, right, I was like,
    well, I can't be bitching out to people who put out my tape, but I was
    thinking, 'Aw, man, that was supposed to be the last song on the tape! Now
    what have you done? Now everyone will think the sequence is all messed up
    when they hear this magnificent tape, Taboo VI: The Homecoming, oh no, oh
    no!  History will not tell the truth about this album.' So, that's why

[^alaskajohn]:
    "people ask me about 'the creative process'\* and here's this song, I'll
    tell you a little about it: I was living in employee housing in Norwalk. I
    had been writing poetry since I was 14: about eight years. When you're 22
    'since I was fourteen' feels like 'all my life,' or did to me, though time
    gives one perspective on this feeling. Anyway, I'd gone from free verse
    crew to meter and rhyme patrol, as many do, and had arrived at a nice
    synthesis for me, where I was comfortable working in meter but admired
    writers who could work in variable line-lengths and still have their verse
    sing: whose poems still felt like verse, like song, which I still felt &
    feel is the parent tree from which poetry oughtn't fall too far.

    "I had written some songs, and I don't know where in the writing of that
    first batch I did this, but I still consider this the first Mountain Goats
    song (or second; 'The Pieman' also vies for the title). It began life as a
    poem, which I'll transcribe below; I'm not 100% sure that I'm getting all
    the line-stops right, but it's close. (I have consigned as much of my
    poetry from back then to the trash can as I have been able to lay hands
    to.) One day I was sitting around with this Hawaiian guitar I'd bought for
    thirty bucks and a heavy steel slide, bottleneck guitar, and I had a
    progression I liked and wanted to sing something to it, so I sang that
    poem, and that's what happened.

    "Huge credit to [Lewis Turco, whose
    book](http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Book-Forms-Handbook/dp/0874513812) I
    had been studying --- when I say 'studying,' I mean 'spending several
    hours a day with, writing poems and lines in notebooks on the floor of my
    apartment, doing this to the exclusion of other activity' --- the
    introduction to that book played a huge part in getting me comfortable
    with rhythm and meter, in getting from the 'ok, yes, technically that's a
    pentameter line' stage to somewhere near the goal of 'these lines sound
    natural, and they're also metered.' I was trying, too, to write poems that
    worked like Browning's Dramatis Personae (and like the stuff in Norman
    Dubie's Groom Falconer, which was new-ish, and which I was freaking out
    about): where the narrator, who seems to just be talking, tells you a lot
    about himself (much of it often not very pretty) and tells a story in the
    process without actually laying down a clear narrative line: puzzles. I
    suspect that I submitted this to several poetry journals, who I now thank
    for rejecting it. It works better with a little guitar.

    "\*I am allergic to this term though, it's just work, a kind of work,
    better to think in terms of baking or cooking: what are the ingredients,
    how much of each, how hot does it gotta get in the room they're put
    together for things to come out right"

    "That song was a poem first. I was writing poems, and I had that poem, and
    I thought, 'Boy, the language in this is pretty decent, this is a nice
    piece of writing', and then I had this new guitar and I had a slide, a
    Hawaiian finger covering slide, and I tuned the guitar to a chord, and
    worked on it, and I thought, you know, that sounds pretty cool, you know.
    And you can hear the rhythms, the speech rhythms, in a way that you can't

    interview, April 7, 2011

    "This song was originally a poem. This is, if not the very first Mountain
    Goats song --- it's not the first one, but I was writing poetry. I was
    going to be a famous poet. It was gonna be amazing. I was going to remind
    people how, that they have poetry in their spirits and bodies, that they
    really enjoy poetry. There was gonna be a thing I was gonna do, and so I
    was going to poetry readings. Poetry readings will disabuse you of your
    idea that people are gonna love poetry and it's really gonna inspire them
    in their minds and their bodies. Because although I love all the poets,
    every last one of them with everything in me, they are the only people at
    the poetry readings. So I started putting some of them to music because I
    liked them and I wanted people to hear them in some way. And this was one
    that was a poem that I had labored very hard on, and then I bought this
    cheap guitar that you played with a slide, right, and I tuned it to an
    open tuning and on the original version that I don't know if anybody's
    heard it before: *weeeerow*, *wEEEErow*, *weeerow*, just insufferably for
    two minutes." Old Town School of Folk Music, Chicago, April 20, 2014

    Both of these samples come from an episode of the original 1968 cop drama

    Five-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_Five-O_(1968_TV_series)). The
    episode, [A Touch of Guilt](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0597998/), is the
    13th episode in the 8th season (occasionally listed as the 14th due to the
    first episode being sometimes aired in two parts). The main character,
    Detective Captain Steve McGarrett, is investigating three football players
    who raped a waitress. One of the players' father is a powerful US Senator
    who is attempting to spike the investigation.

    These lines take place shortly after each other early in the episode
    (about 7 minutes in and 10 minutes in, respectively). The first two lines
    are between Detective Sergeant Daniel "Danno" Williams --- McGarrett's
    sidekick --- and McGarrett, where McGarret assigns Danno to the case. The
    lines at the end of the song are between Alex Scofield, one of the cocky,
    rapist football players and the senator Anthony Scofield's son, and Hal
    Zimmerman, Senator Scofield's assistant sent to pin the assault on someone
    else to divert controversy away from the senator.

    sad-sounding song.

[^lonesomespanish]:
    The entire song is simultaneously translated into Spanish spoken over
    John's singing. The translation was done by John's then-girlfriend
    Leticia. I believe she says the following:

    > Eso que significa ha perdido \[la voluntad de vivir\] \\
    > Estoy tan solo que puedo llorar
    >
    > El silencio de la estrella que caída \\
    > Ha luz a el cielo morado \\
    > Y luego pienso donde estás \\
    > Estoy tan solo de que, que puedo llorar \\

    intended to be there to complete the sentence. (This was a challenge to
    transcribe, so please, if you see Spanish errors or heard something
    different, [por favor dígame](../about.html#contact). I think there may be
    some errors in the Spanish translation, which I've preserved here, but I
    could also just have misheard it). The Spanish phrases are nearly a
    word-for-word translation of the song with some creative license --- for
    example, the third verse says, "Have you seen a bird pass so slowly",
    among other small changes.

## Eleven Bands [^bandsseries] [^congress] [^bonus] [^bandsnall] ## {#bands}

Follow the grass up the foot of the mountain \\
Follow the twisting branches \\
When you look at them remember that they \\
Are alive and flowing still \\
See their colors lighten as you climb \\
Watch the sunlight catch them and reflect them \\
It reflects them everywhere

One of these paths leading up the nameless mountain \\
Was the one that told you something once \\
But you will not find it here \\
It has shriveled up and wriggled off the mountain \\
Like a dying vine \\
Once these things take on their weightlessness \\
The structure comes apart \\
How do the trees grow in this weather \\
It is freezing cold \\
Take the path on up the mountainside \\
And all the sounds from far and wide \\
Will leave you suddenly \\
And sugared winds come through the clouds
