## Cao Dai Blowout [^caodai] ## {#caodai}

He came knocking down the streetlights \\
Tearing up the new grass on the lawn \\
He was frightening all the livestock \\
I could feel him coming on

I lit the citronella, [^citronella] it was all that I had [^dissolve] \\
And I began to feel real bad \\
When the ghost of your father comes to town \\
What the hell else can you do \\
I flung open all the windows, put the water on for tea \\
And let him pass right on through

And he took to knocking over furniture \\
Getting into the reception on the wireless \\
He tore up all the dry goods in the pantry \\
He was strong and he was tireless

And when the priest came to call, I sent him on his way \\
I got a tremor in my hand and my feet are made of clay \\
When the ghost of your father starts pushing you around \\
How are you gonna make him stop \\
I took down all the crosses \\
I let him set up shop

[^citronella]:
    [Citronella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citronella_oil) is an aromatic
    oil derived from lemongrass used as a perfume and an insect repellent.

[^dissolve]:
    Nall lists this as, "[I let the citronella dissolve in my
    hand](http://themountaingoats.net/lyrics/cinema_lyr.html#cao)". It's
    challenging to hear on the recording, but the wording given here seems
    accurate based on live recordings.

[^caodai]:
    Cao Đài is the name for God in
    [Caodaism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_%C4%90%C3%A0i), a Vietnamese
    monotheistic religion formed in 1926 and active in resisting French
    colonialism. Caodaists believe in a karmic cycle of life and death, which
    they strive to escape through their actions and beliefs.

## Korean Bird Paintings ## {#korean}

*"OK."*

Yesterday I put in a good five hours \\
Talking to the statues \\
Chased your memory all around the room \\
Didn't manage to catch you \\
But I cleaned out the savings account \\
Blew everything I had on flowers \\
And I covered up the furniture in carnations \\
Rolled around for hours \\
And there are those of you who've got the wrong idea right now \\
But man, you should have seen me when I got through \\
Indistinguishable from a fourth century Briton [^briton] \\
Waiting on the couch for you \\
And I put all the extras on the credit card \\
Mobiles of the galaxy and Mylar [^mylar] balloons \\
Everything we'd saved up in one room at the same time \\
Our two stars, crescent moons \\
Thank you notes, get well cards \\
Condolences, congratulations \\
Bright colors, cues and signals \\
Reminders and reverberations

[^briton]:
    The [Britons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britons_(Celtic_people)) were
    a Celtic people inhabiting southern Great Britain from the Iron Age
    through Roman times, eventually being pushed out or blending with the
    Anglo-Saxons in the 5th century.

[^mylar]:
    [Mylar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoPET), a brand name for
    biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate, is a reflective plastic
    sheet material presumably used here to reflect the sun.

## Narakaloka [^narakalokajohn] [^krimibhojana] ## {#narakaloka}

The cabbages and I will grow \\
One by one and row on row \\
Will fatten in the spring sun \\
And breathe in the evening air

You will hear them breathing \\
If you walk by at night \\
You may not hear them after all \\
And that's all right

I've set the table for two \\
I've cleaned the windows for you \\
I got cinnamon from Jakarta [^jakarta] \\
Making French toast \\
Doctor says that I've got \\
30 days left at most

Cabbages that I will grow \\
The love songs on the radio \\
Will deepen in the springtime \\
They'll be brighter than the stars

[^narakalokajohn]:
    "According to Sukadeva Gosvami there are 28 different hells, each one
    worse than the one before. At the very bottom of these, is the hell reserved
    for those who, having a little food, neglect to share it with a guest and
    instead eat it for themselves. This place is called Narakaloka, and in it
    is a lake some 800,000 miles wide filled with worms feeding on one
    another. And your destiny --- there are as many worms in the lake as there
    are miles across it --- and your destiny is to eat and be eaten until all
    the worms have had their way with you." --- Empty Bottle, Chicago,
    December 6, 1997. See also CD Exchange, Bloomington, January 30, 1999;
    Cat's Cradle, Carrboro, January 27, 1999.

    "Although how that ties into this song is a great mystery that only I know
    the answer to." --- Cat's Cradle, Carrboro, January 27, 1999
    
    Sukadeva Gosvami, known also as
    [Shuka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuka), is the narrator of the Hindu
    text Bhagavata Purana, a devotional text to the Krishna incarnation of
    Vishnu.

[^krimibhojana]:
    [Naraka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naraka_(Hinduism)) seems to
    generally refer to the entirety of the 28 Hindu hells (with the number and
    name of Naraka varying from tradition to tradition). What [John describes
    above](#fn:narakalokajohn) is more commonly called Krimibhojana:

    > A person is considered no better than a crow if after receiving some food,
    > he does not divide it among guests, old men and children, but simply eats
    > it himself, or if he eats it without performing the five kinds of
    > sacrifice. After death he is put into the most abominable hell, known as
    > Krimibhojana. In that hell is a lake 100,000 yojanas \[800,000 miles\]
    > wide and filled with worms. He becomes a worm in that lake and feeds on
    > the other worms there, who also feed on him. Unless he atones for his
    > actions before his death, such a sinful man remains in the hellish lake of
    > Krmibhojana for as many years as there are yojanas in the width of the
    > lake.

[^jakarta]:
    [Jakarta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta) is the capital city of
    Indonesia and its largest city, located on the island of Java. 28 million
    people live in its metropolitan area, with nearly 10 million in the city
    limits itself.

## Golden Jackal Song [^jackal] ## {#jackal}

I swung through town \\
Shining like a new quarter \\
Felt something sharp rise up within me \\
When I crossed the border

Stopped at the gas station payphone \\
I let my fingers fly \\
The wicked impulses were dying \\
But I couldn't let them die

And we were over at your place, singing about the old times \\
No one had anything to prove \\
I ate so much carrion \\
That I could not move \\
I was bloated

When I saw your kitchen \\
Glistening like the old country \\
All your cups and glasses \\
Lined up in front of me

And I stopped at the faucet for a minute \\
Waved 'til you came in to see what was wrong \\
Your fingers brushed my ribs playfully \\
I played along

And you had your tongue in my mouth \\
Your eyes glistening in the light \\
I ate rich, raw carrion \\
Until I couldn't think right \\
I was a ghoul [^full]

[^jackal]:
    The [golden jackal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_jackal), *Canis
    aureus*, is a species of wild canine native to North Africa and much of
    Eurasia. The species fills a mythological role as a trickster deity in
    many religions in areas it inhabits.

[^full]:
    Nall lists this lyric as "I was full", but I'm not sure I hear it that
    way. Unfortunately, there are no live recordings of this song that I know
    of to which we can compare the lyrics, so I'm uncertain of this final line.

## Treetop Song ## {#treetop}

All along the interstate \\
The palm trees were calling out to me \\
And the line of them stretched down the highway forever \\
As far as I could see

And I waited 'til the sun was coming up \\
Light morning traffic and a cool spring breeze \\
And I heard the old voices calling down to me \\
From the tops of the trees

And when I got up to the top, my head got light \\
And for a minute everything in the world was all right \\
And I saw the next tree just ten feet away \\
Give or take a few feet, I guess

And then I pushed off into the air with all of my might \\
And headed out into the center of the morning light \\
And I knew that I was gonna make it \\
The new tree hardly shook to acknowledge my arrival \\
And I knew that I would be all right
