[^chile]:
    [Chile de árbol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile_de_árbol), Spanish for
    tree chili, is an extremely spicy pepper native to Mexico.

[^chilejohn]:
    On the [Protein Source of the Future... NOW!](protein.html) compilation
    liner notes, John writes:

    These songs would all sound great in the hands of '80s new wave bands ---
    not New Wave proper, you understand, but the commercial aftermath: Adam
    and the Ants, Duran Duran, Kajagoogoo, Thomas Dolby, and so forth. Is
    there any sacrifice I would not make to hear Spandau Ballet doing "Bill
    the Kid's Dream of the Magic Shoes"? No, No, there is not.

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

For in oure wyl ther stiketh ever a nayl
To have an hoor heed and a grene tayl,
As hath a leek; for though oure myght be goon,
Oure wyl desireth folie evere in oon.

--- Geoffrey CHAUCER, Reeve's prologue II. 3877--3880 [^chaucer]

OIGA SOMOS MUCHISIMAS GRACIAS: [^thanks]

Leti, Mark Givens que pintó las escobas, Dennis, Tim, E.F. que nos enseñó la
lengua Latina, Bob Durkee, Barry Sanders [^sanders] maestro poderoso, y la
Santa Vírgen de Guadalupe [^mary] por su intercesión eterno. [^spanish]

HEUS, PAMPHILA! [^latin] Special thanks to T. MACCUS PLAUTIUS, [^plautius]
that wonderful man.

[^chaucer]:
    [Geoffrey Chaucer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer) was an
    extremely influential English poet from the 14th century. His most
    significant work, The Canterbury Tales, quoted here, is a frame tale in
    which a group of pilgrims to Canterbury Cathedral compete in a
    storytelling contest. Specifically, the Reeve's Tale ridicules a thieving
    miller who receives his comeuppance amid gratuitous sex.

    A modern English rendering of this stanza is as follows:

    It ever pricks our will just like a nail \\
    To have a hoary head and a green tail, \\
    As does a leek. Although our might is gone, \\
    Our will is that the folly carry on.

    into Modern English](http://english.fsu.edu/canterbury/index.html).
    Palatka: Hodge & Braddock. ISBN 0-9636512-3-4

[^thanks]:
    In Spanish, "Hear us, many thanks."

[^sanders]:
    [Barry Sanders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Sanders) was a running
    back for the Detroit Lions, one of the best players to ever hold the
    position and holder of numerous awards.

[^mary]:
    [Our Lady of
    Guadalupe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Guadalupe) is a term
    for Mary, the mother of Jesus, originating from a famous painting of Mary
    in a church in Mexico City, associated with multiple purported miracles.

[^spanish]:
    Translated from Spanish, "Leti, Mark Givens who painted the escolas,
    Dennis, Tim, E.F. who taught us the Latin language, Bob Durkee, Barry
    Sanders powerful master, and the Holy Virgin of Guadalupe for her eternal
    intercession." My best guess is that *escolas* is a misspelling of
    *escuelas*, and thus means schools.

[^latin]:
    In Latin, "Hey, Pamphila!" While I could not find this exact line in his
    works, Pamphila appears as a minor character in Plautus' work *Stichus*.
    Pamphila could also refer to [Pamphila of
    Epidaurus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamphile_of_Epidaurus), an
    Egyptian historian of Greece living in the first century AD.

    Menander](http://www.jstor.org/stable/261982). *Classical Philology*,
    11(1), 61 -- 64.

[^plautius]:
    Titus Maccius Plautius, more frequently,
    [Plautus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plautus) was a prolific Roman
    playwright, often writing comedies, from the second and third centuries
    BC.

## Night of the Mules [^mulesseries] [^christmas] ## {#mules}

*"... once more. Suppose we can only find ten like this in there..."*
[^suppose]

Streetlights gave off a yellow glow \\
On the holly and the mistletoe \\
You could feel the rain coming down \\
The quiet starlight hardened the ground \\
'Til the street shone like a diamond, look sister \\
Here comes a new genuine disaster \\
Clip clop, up the street \\
See the rain, feel the sleet \\
Yeah

The cold air, unpredictable weather \\
Ten or twenty of us huddled together \\
Hearing the praying growing louder \\
Snowflakes falling, fine white powder \\
Here come the new kings \\
The hooves clack, the metal sings \\
Clip clop, up the street \\
See the rain, feel the sleet \\
Yeah

[^mulesseries]:
    Night of the Mules is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^christmas]:
    Given the references to holly and mistletoe, prayer, kings, starlight, and
    mules or donkeys, it seems likely that this song describes the [Nativity
    of Jesus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nativity_of_Jesus).

[^suppose]:
    While the source of this recording is unknown, the speaker is quoting
    Genesis 18, in which Abraham begs God to spare the city of
    [Sodom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodom_and_Gomorrah), if a few good
    people can be found there. As God agrees to spare the city for even fewer
    and fewer people, Abraham is satisfied at ten people:

    > And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but
    > this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not
    > destroy it for ten's sake.

    If you know where this recording is from, please [let me
    know](../about.html#contact)!

## Going to Malibu [^malibuseries] [^malibu] ## {#malibu}

When we meet on neutral ground \\
I can't believe how good you look \\
And the thoughts that race around my mind \\
Could fill a long unreadable book \\
And I can hear the waves \\
I can sense the continent eroding \\
You say you know why I called you here \\
But you couldn't have any way of knowing \\
So that's not true \\
That's a mean thing to say \\
That's a damnable lie \\
That's a damnable lie

Looking at you and I don't know \\
What it is I see \\
But I know you're changing \\
Almost indetectably \\
And I see a ship off the shore \\
And I imagine it sinking \\
And you smile and you say that you know \\
What it is that I'm thinking \\
That's not true \\
That's a rotten thing to say \\
That's a damnable lie \\
That's a damnable lie

[^malibuseries]:
    Going to Malibu is part of the [Going to ... series](series.html#goingto).

[^malibu]:
    [Malibu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu,_California) is a city in Los
    Angeles County, California.

## Billy the Kid's Dream of the Magic Shoes [^billythekid] [^specialshoes] ## {#billy}

Gonna hang me out to dry \\
They're gonna hang me out to dry \\
I don't really care \\
I don't really care \\
I got special shoes [^specialshoes] \\
I got special shoes

They're gonna fill me full of holes \\
They're gonna fill me full of holes \\
I don't give a rat's ass \\
I don't give a rat's ass, you rat bastards \\
I got special shoes on \\
I got special shoes on \\
Yeah

[^billythekid]:
    [Billy the Kid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_the_Kid), born William
    McCarty, was a notorious outlaw in the 19th century American West, killing
    8 -- 21 people. Another Mountain Goats song, Catherine Antrim's Kid, is
    also about Billy the Kid, and similarly uses the special shoes motif.

[^specialshoes]:
    This is a perplexing line. Special shoes show up in multiple songs,
    including Catherine Antrim's Kid, the other song about Billy the Kid, but
    also in The Day the Aliens Came, implying that perhaps this has a deeper
    meaning. On the other hand, it could be interpreted at face value.

    To take a long chain of reasoning, Lon Chaney, Jr. (the subject of Rotten
    Stinking Mouthpiece) played a role in a [1941 film about Billy the
    Kid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_the_Kid_(1941_film)). Two years
    previously, he had worn height-increasing shoes on Of Mice and Men, and
    purportedly his tremendous increase in height was reported for many years.
    While this link strikes me as being tenuous, it also would not surprise
    me, even if at present I think there's no reason to believe this
    connection to be valid.

## Fresh Berries for You ## {#berries}

World's overrun with new shades of green \\
And the dandelions come up like recurring dreams \\
And the swallows give up their fragile little songs \\
To the new world

And I know you're only watching out for yourself \\
And I know I'm not to take it real personal-like \\
And I know you only want what's best for everybody \\
I know you only want what's best for everybody \\
But you better be nice or the Easter Bunny's gonna strike your name out of the little red book with the silver hinges on it that he carries [^bunny]

They've implemented a new system on the exhaust lines of the buses \\
And now the air is fresh and sweet and clean when they pass by \\
And the bright sun shines down on our fair city \\
And young cats play on people's front lawns

And the time is coming \\
And the time is coming \\
And I can feel the time coming \\
And I know you can feel the time coming yourself \\
And the Easter Bunny's coming and God knows I'd hate for you to miss it

It's gonna be so nice \\
When the Easter Bunny comes \\
It's gonna be so nice \\
When the Easter Bunny comes \\
It's gonna be so nice \\
When the Easter Bunny comes \\
It's gonna be so nice \\
When the Easter Bunny comes

[^bunny]:
    The [Easter Bunny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Bunny) is a
    popular symbol for Easter dating back to the 17th century, depicting a
    rabbit bringing eggs and candy to children on Easter. Originally the
    rabbit behaved like an Easter Santa Claus, judging children for being good
    or bad. However, I'm not aware of any stories in which the Easter Bunny
    carries a red book, that may be a Mountain Goats invention.

## Alphabetizing [^alphabetizingjohn] [^alphabetizingseries] ## {#alphabetizing}

Summer crawled by indetectably \\
And then I saw you looking down to me \\
And your earrings sparkled in the noonday sun \\
And though it's very true that I love everyone \\
With every ounce of energy left in me \\
I love you especially, because \\
I saw you \\
Coming through \\
The screen door \\
On the second floor \\
Up on the balcony

It was hard to even see you at all \\
Because the air was thick with alcohol \\
So I kept on rubbing my eyes \\
For all the good it did me, for all the measurable good it did me \\
Let the years come and take away my memory \\
I will not forget the shock that ran through me when \\
I saw you \\
Coming through \\
The screen door \\
On the second floor \\
Up on the balcony

[^alphabetizingjohn]:
    "I ripped off the chord progression of that from something that was on the
    Electric Company. You can barely hear it. Something to do with water." ---
    Dennis Kucinich benefit, San Francisco, February 11, 2004

    John confirms that this is an Alpha song at Hopscotch, Durham, September
    8, 2012.

[^alphabetizingseries]:
    Alphabetizing is part of the [Alpha couple series](series.html#alpha).
