Released: 2009 \\
Label: Cadmean Dawn

[^mcbjohn]:
    The EP was originally released as tour-only, eventually coming out on mail
    order, but never available for digital download. It is constructed as
    songs selected from an unwritten rock opera. Attucks Theatre, Norfolk,
    Virginia, March 20, 2009. See also [here](#fn:surroundedjohn).

    Releasing the demo to Surrounded, as the first announcement of the EP,
    John writes:

    > collaborative album. Our schedules have yet to allow us to do much more

[^comedians]:
    Occasionally, this record is credited to The Comedians, as that's how the
    demo to Surrounded was tagged (as well as being from the album
    Transplants). However, the official release simply credits The Mountain
    Goats and John Vanderslice.

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

*(dark text):*

All lyrics copied verbatim from newspapers except as indicated [^newspaper]

Thanks to Albert II [^albertII] who deserved better

*(light text):*

The Plexiglass domes flow across the surface of the Moon like fields of wheat.
Build using prison labor in 1970 and '71, they exist in an official
vapor-realm: their documentation isn't suppressed per se, but is camouflaged
by needless technical jargon that runs into the thousands of pages. These
files are available to the public, but they sit in file cabinets somewhere
near Orlando, [^orlando] gathering dust and serving their purpose thereby.

In the thirty-four years since the construction of the domes was completed,
over five thousand bodies have been sent there, to exist permanently on life
support in a totally sterile environment. These bodies have provided organs to
every major hospital in the western world. The crew that tends them was culled
from various centers where the forgotten gather: soup kitchens, used
bookstores, public parks. They rotate out of duty every six months, spending
their time on Earth in opulent but total seclusion on government-owned land in
Colorado. [^colorado] Those who have family find their husbands or wives,
their children or parents, waiting for them at home when they return.

Our protagonist is a man who, bored out of his mind working in the
organ-harvesting domes of the Moon, takes to sleeping in one of the
life-supporting apparatuses intended only for the only-technically-alive
bodies he stewards. Our story begins on during his sojourn back home in the
dead of winter, brought to you in hidden infrastructure.

[^albertII]:
    There have been a number of people named Albert II, almost all royalty.
    However, given the context of the EP, I believe this refers to [Albert
    II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkeys_and_apes_in_space#United_States),
    the second monkey astronaut and the first to successfully enter space, who
    died from impacting the Earth after his parachute failed. He was named not
    after royalty but after the first monkey, Albert.

[^newspaper]:
    Perhaps related, perhaps not, as John describes the EP in his introduction
    to Surrounded at the Swedish-American Hall, San Francisco, June 27, 2012,
    he says, "But nobody seemed to care about the whole deal, we tried to talk
    about it in interviews, we called the TV stations, nothing. Send letters
    to the local press, a lot of letters to the local press, 'Haven't you
    heard about the organ-harvesting colonies on the Moon? We wrote a six-song
    EP about it, here's a link to a download.' Well, we can track that shit,
    none of those newspapers downloaded our EP. They didn't really seem to
    care. Then we started to think that they were in on the con. We're like,
    maybe it's a whole newspaper thing. Maybe it's the newspaper magnates that
    are the ones growing the bodies on the Moon where the organs are grown and
    harvested. And then we thought, 'Well, yeah, but the newspapers aren't
    even doing so good.' And then we thought, 'But maybe that's why! It's
    like, that's their next line, it's sort of a natural progression, you go
    from reporting on people in print media to growing bodies from which
    you're going to harvest organs." --- Swedish-American Hall, San Francisco,
    June 27, 2012

[^orlando]:
    [Orlando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida) is a major city
    in Florida, located near the center of the state.

[^colorado]:
    [Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado) is an American state in
    the central west of the country, containing large amounts of open land and
    wilderness. As stated in the [liner notes](#liner), this is the place
    where organ harvesting workers live while on Earth.

## Surrounded [^surroundedjohn] [^surroundeddemo] ## {#surrounded}

Pale white moon, shine down on Colorado [^colorado] \\
Hide my dirty secrets \\
Down here in the shadows \\
Where the quaking aspens \\
Tremble in the snow \\
Haul me up the hillside \\
Hold me high and let me go \\
Let me fall right through my own roof like a meteorite \\
Let the world and all its wonders leave me to my toys tonight \\
And my 96 inch television screen \\
Let me die, let me die \\
Surrounded by machines

High winds knocked the power out last night \\
But I've got my own supply here \\
All my windows blaze with light \\
And the light spills through the windows \\
To the empty plain below \\
Finds nothing but some trees \\
And six fresh feet [^three] of snow \\
And I find a broadcast station that's signed off for the night \\
And the static floods the speakers in glorious black and white \\
On my 96 inch television screen \\
Let me die, let me die \\
Surrounded by machines

[^surroundedjohn]:
    John often describes the EP when introducing Surrounded, so some of these
    quotes are [repeated from above](#fn:mcbjohn) with some more of the quotes
    that are Surrounded-specific.

    "This is one of those songs about, you know, organ harvesting colonies on
    the Moon. \<laughter\> It is, though. It's --- John Vanderslice and I just
    finished up an EP --- yeah, man. And we've been talking about this EP for
    years, right. And at one point it was going to be a whole album about ---
    well, I'm proud of this storyline --- about a guy who's part of this
    program where they have host bodies in little capsules all on the surface
    of the Moon growing organs for use on the Earth, and somebody of course
    must tend to these colonies of organs, but of course there's ethical
    questions with growing organs in a body you're going to discard, right. So
    the people who work on these Moon organ harvesting colonies are sworn to
    secrecy, they can't really have a life, they can't be married, and they
    can't have friends, they can't live in cities, they have to live lives of
    utter secrecy and privacy and silence during their six months on Earth,
    and the other six months they're up on the Moon, they can tell whoever
    they like, 'cause there's nobody else up on the Moon. So in exchange, they
    live in opulence and solitude. This is from the song that introduces us to
    the main character of the rock opera that will never be written, but of
    which a few songs survive." --- City Arts and Lectures, Herbst Theatre,
    San Francisco, February 24, 2009. See also Swedish-American Hall, San
    Francisco, June 27, 2012; Front Porch Festival, Wente Vineyards,

    2014.

    "This is a song about his home up in the hills out West." --- Attucks
    Theatre, Norfolk, Virginia, March 20, 2009

    I feel compelled to mention that there is an *amazing* version of this
    track on the Fair Game session, March 4, 2008, that is so, so good that
    you should go listen to it right now.

[^surroundeddemo]:
    A demo to Surrounded was released as a Christmas gift in 2007, similarly
    to the release of the demo to Michael Myers Resplendent in 2006:

    > As longtime readers know, we have a tradition around here of an annual
    > holiday giveaway. By "longtime" here we mean "people who were also reading
    > this page last December," and by "annual tradition," we mean "we also did
    > this last year." 2006's yuletide gift was the demo for "Michael Myers
    > Resplendent," which turned out to be the album-closing song on the
    > forthcoming [Heretic Pride](http://www.4ad.com/releases/heretic-pride-1/),
    > which, need I remind you, you can totally
    > [preorder](http://www.beggarsgroupusa.com/releases/Heretic-Pride/).
    >
    > But I am not here to badger you about pre-orders! No! I come to give you a
    > real oddity.
    >
    > For years, John Vanderslice and I have been talking about doing a

    As [mentioned above](#fn:comedians), the demo is tagged as being by the
    Comedians and from the album Transplants, perhaps an early working title
    or just a joke.

    The [demo](#fn:surroundeddemo) instead contains the line, "And three fresh
    feet of snow".

## Lucifer Rising [^luciferseries] [^luciferrising] ## {#lucifer}

Call me the running man \\
Call me Alachua County [^alachua] Bill \\
Call me dripping water underneath the phosphor [^phosphor] still \\
Call me John the Ripper [^ripper] tearing at your skin \\
One day I'll pay for this \\
For now, just let me in

It's a straight walk home \\
It's a straight walk home \\
It's a straight walk home \\
Straight walk home \\
Through the generation fields \\
And the ventilation dome \\
Body after body, alone

Nix your dirty water \\
Forget your resource management skills \\
I crawl starving down sloping Colorado hills \\
Call me John the Ripper [^ripper] tearing at your skin \\
One day I'll pay for this \\
For now, just let me in

It's a straight walk home \\
Straight walk home \\
Straight walk home \\
Straight walk home \\
Through the generation fields \\
And the ventilation dome \\
Body after body, alone

[^luciferseries]:
    Lucifer Rising is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^luciferrising]:
    There are a few possibilities for this reference, but given the mention of
    Beausoleil in [Scorpio Rising](#scorpio), which itself is another title of
    a Kenneth Anger short film, this must refer to [Lucifer
    Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer_Rising_(film)), Kenneth
    Anger's surreal 1972 short film with lava, Egyptian deities, and UFOs,
    symbolically representing a spiritual revolution. The soundtrack to the
    film has a strange history, originally written by Jimmy Page, and then
    rescored by [Bobby Beausoleil](#fn:beausoleil), who completed the score in
    prison after his conviction for one of the Manson murders. The film also
    features Chris Jagger, Mick Jagger's brother.

    After a falling out with Anger, Beausoleil purportedly stole some of the
    footage and buried it in the Mojave Desert outside of Los Angeles. Anger
    then made [Invocation of My Demon
    Brother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invocation_of_My_Demon_Brother) out
    of the remains.

[^alachua]:
    [Alachua County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alachua_County,_Florida) is
    a county in northern Florida. This reference is otherwise unclear to me,
    if you understand it, please [let me know](../about.html#contact).

[^phosphor]:
    [Phosphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphor) is any luminescent
    material.

[^ripper]:
    A reference to [Jack the
    Ripper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_the_Ripper), a notorious and
    unidentified 19th century English murderer of prostitutes in Whitechapel,
    London. I don't know what the significance of the name change to John is,
    if any.

## Satori in Denver [^satori] [^denver] ## {#satori}

Speed down 24 [^us24] toward the city for supplies [^city] \\
Technically out of bounds \\
Roll my window down, hear my tires sing to the asphalt \\
And drink in the highway sounds

Oh, solitude, friend of the friendless \\
Light in the dark night coming on \\
Grab what I want without saying a word \\
And drive through the dark 'til dawn

Track lights blur together, anklet buzzing on my leg \\
Thinking up lies to tell \\
And this may be the time I get banished from the palace \\
To seek out some smaller cell

Oh, solitude, friend of the friendless \\
Light in the dark night coming on \\
Grab what I want without saying a word \\
And ride through the dark 'til dawn

[^satori]:
    [Satori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satori) is Japanese for
    "awakening" or "understanding". It refers to the first steps towards
    complete enlightenment in the Japanese and Zen Buddhist traditions, where
    a student begins to see their true nature.

[^denver]:
    [Denver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver) is the capital of and
    largest city in Colorado, located a short distance north of [Route
    24](#fn:us24).

[^us24]:
    [Route 24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_24_in_Colorado) is an
    east-west road through Colorado, beginning in Minturn in the Rocky
    Mountains, heading south to Buena Vista, where it then traverses east,
    joining Interstate 70 to terminate at the Kansas border. Given that the
    protagonist lives, like other organ harvesters in the Colorado hills, this
    implies to me that he resides somewhere along this road in the Rockies,
    west of Colorado Springs. See [below](#fn:city).

[^city]:
    The main city on Route 24 is [Colorado
    Springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado),
    although this could refer to the title town of Denver, located north of 24
    along Interstate 25, or other, smaller towns. See also
    [above](#fn:us24) and [above](#fn:denver).

## Scorpio Rising [^scorpiorising] ## {#scorpio}

Out in the desert in the last light of day \\
We search for the footprints of Bobby Beausoleil [^beausoleil] \\
And there in the desert past the LA county line \\
Bobby buried the canister in the middle of the night [^luciferrising]

I'm not all right \\
I'm not all right \\
I'm really not up for the fight

Slow it down \\
Slow it down, down, down \\
Slow it down \\
Slow it down, down, down

The gears grind on as the van accelerates \\
Some things buried deep need to stay that way

I'm not all right \\
I'm not all right \\
I'm really not up for the fight

Slow it down \\
Slow it down, down, down \\
Slow it down \\
Slow it down, down, down \\
Slow it down \\
Slow it down, down, down \\
Slow it down

[^scorpiorising]:
    As with [Lucifer Rising](#fn:luciferrising), a surreal Kenneth Anger short
    film made in 1963. The film depicts motorcycle gang member and
    methamphetamine addict Scorpio through comparisons to Jesus Christ,
    Hitler, and Satan, amid homoerotic and violent imagery and a rock
    soundtrack. It's not clear to me how this or Lucifer Rising relate to the
    EP.

[^beausoleil]:
    [Bobby Beausoleil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Beausoleil) was a
    musician and actor involved with Kenneth Anger's film [Lucifer
    Rising](#fn:luciferrising). Beausoleil gained notoriety for his role in
    the Manson murders, where he killed music teacher Gary Hinman in his Los
    Angeles home in 1969 over a purported failed drug deal. Beausoleil is
    currently serving a life sentence, commuted from death after the Supreme
    Court ruled the death sentence unconstitutional. Again, I'm not sure what
    this has to do with the EP.

## Sudden Oak Death [^suddenjohn] [^oakdeath] ## {#sudden}

Lose a little feeling in my fingers \\
Gain an edge of panic in my face \\
Search for some sign to tell me just how long I've been here \\
Overturn the place

Feels like each time my efforts fail \\
The whole hillsides disapprove \\
Feel like a man whose veins have frozen overnight \\
Lying there, trying to move

Yeah, when the crack sounds in the wood \\
You will know that I'm down for good \\
When the crack sounds in the wood \\
You will know, old friend, that I'm down for good

I want to try to stand my ground \\
Dig my heels into the hills \\
Hope someone will come to right my balance \\
No one will

Feels like when I try to stretch my legs \\
Everyone around me's trying too \\
So ready just to fall down, just to fall down and to stay down \\
I don't wanna spoil the view

Yeah, when the crack sounds in the wood \\
You will know that I'm down for good \\
When the crack sounds in the wood \\
You will know, old friend, that I'm down for good

[^suddenjohn]:
    "This song, just between you and me... doesn't really fit the theme of the
    7-song EP we have up for sale, it's kind of the odd man out. It's just a
    song about how sometimes you --- how do I put this without sounding more
    emo than it already is. Look, it is too late. But, I mean, sometimes you
    have a bad day, and you may for a moment think, you know, 'I can't really
    go on like this.' But then, if you are emo, then, you know, you really
    mean it and then you go home and cry... But on the other hand, sometimes
    you have a year where you think to yourself, 'I'm not gonna last, this
    isn't gonna work out, I'm going to keep showing up to the things that I'm
    supposed to show up for, and I'm gonna try and be a stand-up dude or woman
    about it, but I don't --- but something has got to break.' ... Something
    bad's gonna happen. And you feel like that. And I hardly think I'm alone
    in having had these experiences. So I sort of compared it to a thing that
    happens with trees." --- Buskirk-Chumley Theater, Bloomington, April 6,
    2009

[^oakdeath]:
    Sudden oak death is a disease caused by the oomycete [*Phytophthora
    ramorum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytophthora_ramorum), which
    causes cankers on the bark and death of the foliage, resulting ultimately
    in the death of the tree. Oaks and many other trees can contract the
    disease, and many, many tree deaths have occurred since the discovery of
    the disease in 1995.

## Columns Pillars Steps ## {#columns}

Try to lie \\

[^dcu]:
    I'm not sure what this means. My best guess is that it's either intended
    to sound like a military acronym (and maybe have meaning at least to John
    and Vanderslice), or that it would refer to the [Desert Camouflage
    Uniform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Camouflage_Uniform),
    therefore referring to a uniform or disguise rather than a location.

## Emerging [^emergingjohn] ## {#emerging}

I'm hungry, but I'm not cold \\
I'm starving but the suit keeps me warm \\
And the light hits me full in the face \\
As I assume my new and dreadful form

Kick an incubator open \\
And like a flower in bloom \\
Sustenance, blessed sustenance \\
Oozing from the tomb

I know that sleeping bodies hide \\
Sweet things inside

And in the ever-present light \\
And in my ever-growing needs \\
If a man should crest the ridge \\
He's gonna have to watch me feed

But no one's ever gonna come \\
And nobody's gonna know \\
I will sail home again \\
Concealed among the upright walking men

To know that sleeping bodies hide \\
Sweet things inside

[^emergingjohn]:
    "This is a song about the organ harvesting colonies on the Moon, and the
    guy who works there and becomes a cannibal and starts eating the corpses
    of which he is supposed to be taking care, you know, growing kidneys for
    the government and stuff... This is a song about when he sort of is up
    there going a little crazy, you know, because he's all alone on the Moon
    except for all the corpses growing in the pods, and you know, and so, he
    begins to eat them. And this is sort of his love song to the corpses he's
    about to eat." --- Attucks Theatre, Norfolk, Virginia, March 20, 2009
