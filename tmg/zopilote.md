### Liner notes ### {#liner}

*(back):*

KID YOU FELL IN THE MILK [^orphism]

*(insert):*

SIC AIT FILIUS IUUENALIS [^latin]

Hello again. There are those who have complained, some of them rather loudly,
about the abundance of untranslated quotations on Mountain Goats records. The
following, written in English and left that way, is a sort of peace offering.
Let it never be said that the Mountain Goats do not aim to please.

*The wood underneath would win and win till the end of time. Of that there was
no doubt possible, only the pain of hope perennially doomed to disappointment.
It was so clear. Of course it was in the nature of the wood to rot with age.
The polish, it was supposed, would catch the rot. But of course in the end it
was the rot which imprisoned everything in its effortless embrace. It did not
really have to fight. Being was enough. In the natural course of things it
would always take the newness of the different kinds of polish and the vaunted
cleansing power of the chemicals in them, and it would convert all to
victorious filth, awaiting yet more polish again and again and again. And the
wood was not alone.*

*--- Ayi Kwei ARMAH. The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born, Chapter One.*
[^armah]
{: .in}

Of course, a careful reading of the **Metamorphoses** of Apuleius
[^metamorphoses] would yield the same information, but what the hell: not
everybody wants to read Apuleius. Go figure.

ZOPILOTE MACHINE is a 19-song mater ferricrepina magna ferocia [^ferricrepina]
and was recorded entirely in California by the Mountain Goats and the Bright
Mountain Choir [^choir].

AT FILIUS INSCITUS FUIT [^latin]
{: .in}

We are Rosanne, Rachel, John, Amy and Saaarah. Bob DURKEE sequenced these;
some of them were recorded with the invaluable assistance of Keith FITZ and
Steve KRONK. Thank you Bob. Thank you Keith. Thank you Steve.

STULTIOR DIEM EX DIE CREUIT [^latin]

The cover photograph is by Marcella ZITA, who is simply the finest independent
filmmaker on the West Coast. [^zita] The Mountain Goats Mandala on the
booklet's back is paint-and-pencil on 20-lb. bond by Mark GIVENS, [^markjoel]
whose constant and unflagging dedication makes our gratitude seem paltry.

DI MAGNI, HIC PUER DOLOR EST MAGNO MIHI [^latin]
{: .in}

The list of people who need to be thanked is too long, but to Leti, Dennis,
Mark, Joel, [^markjoel] Tim, Russell, Franklin, Peter, and everyone at the
Candy Bar our undying gratitude.

[^orphism]:
    A line from one of the [Orphic Gold
    Tablets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totenpass) unearthed in Thurii and
    elsewhere, which gave instructions to the dead in the Orphic religion, a
    set of beliefs related to Ancient Greek religion. Several tablets
    reference falling into milk:

    "Greetings, you who have suffered the painful thing; you have never
    endured this before. \\
    You have become a god instead of a mortal. A kid you fell into milk. \\
    Rejoice, rejoice." Journey on the *right-hand* road \\
    to holy meadows and groves of Persephone.

    Another tablet reads:

    I have sunk beneath the breast of the Lady, the Chthonian Queen, \\
    I have approached the longed-for crown with swift feet. \\
    "Happy and blessed, you will be a god instead of a mortal." \\
    A kid I fell into milk.

    The line in question has generated great curiosity and fewer answers. At
    present, a guess seems to be that "falling into milk" is a metaphor for
    experiencing bliss, however, we don't seem to truly know.

    Bacchic Gold Tablets*. New York: Routledge.

    *Instructions for the Netherworld: The Orphic Gold Tablets*. Netherlands:
    Brill Academic Publishers.

[^latin]:
    I discussed these lines with a professional Latin translator, and they
    gave this translation:

    Thus said the young son \\
    But the son was ignorant \\
    Day by day he grew more stupid \\
    Great gods, this boy is a great pain to me

    They clarified that the final line could also translate to "Great gods,
    this boy is a pain to me, who is older", depending on the interpretation
    of *magno*. The lines, to the best of their and my knowledge, are
    original.

[^armah]:
    [Ayi Kwei Armah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayi_Kwei_Armah) is a Ghanian
    writer, known for writing a number of books, among them Two Thousand
    Seasons, a book about colonialism in Africa and the inspiration for the
    [identically-titled Mountain Goats song](yam.html#twothousand).

    [The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet
    Born](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beautyful_Ones_Are_Not_Yet_Born)
    was Armah's first novel and focuses on coming to terms with the still
    imperfect political state of Ghana after independence.

[^metamorphoses]:
    Apuleius' *Metamorphoses*, more commonly known as [*The Golden
    Ass*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Ass), is a Roman Latin
    novel and the only such novel to survive intact to the modern day. The
    story follows a man, Lucius, desperate to learn magic, who accidentally
    turns himself into a donkey.

[^ferricrepina]:
    According [to the same translator](#fn:latin), these Latin words translate
    to "chain-rattling, high-ferocity mother". The translator informed me that
    *mater* is probably being used as an Anglicism to mean something
    formidable, rather than being used in a characteristic Latin fashion.
    *Ferricrepina* (or *ferricrepinas*, as it was originally used) was
    invented by [Plautus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plautus) for his play
    [Asinaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asinaria). In that context, the
    lines were:

    > Libanus:

    > Vbi flent nequam homines, qui polentam pinsitant. \\
    > apud fústitudinas, ferricrepinas insulas, \\
    > ubi vivos homines mortui incursant boves.

    Libanus, a slave, is begging Demaenetus, his master, not to send him to a
    place where he must do brutal work. Translated, this reads:

    > Why, in the islands of club-land and rattle-chains, where dead oxen attack
    > living men.

    Plautus (1895).

[^choir]:
    The Bright Mountain Choir were a group of four women, Rachel Ware (now
    Zooi), Sarah Arslanian, Amy Piatt, and Roseanne Lindley, who never
    recorded together all at once, but who sang in various combinations on
    many early Mountain Goats records.

[^zita]:
    John mentions that he's lost touch with Zita and doesn't know where to
    find this film anymore in his [interview with Space City
    Rock](http://www.spacecityrock.com/issue4/mountaingoats1.html) (2001). I
    have been unable to find any further information about Zita, but would
    love to hear more if you know something. My best guess is that Zita is
    another local from the Inland Empire scene. Zita also contributed the
    cover to [Sweden](sweden.html#fn:zita).

## Alpha Incipiens [^incipiensjohn] [^incipiensseries] ## {#incipiens}

The morning comes to a stuttering halt \\
The cool breeze that blows is somebody's fault \\
The summer heat tries to burn through \\
And I look over toward you \\
But something's happening

The morning glories climb the wall \\
And you speak in a slow drawl \\
I'm trying to piece together what you're saying \\
But the birds are screeching and the hounds are baying \\
I don't remember there being any hounds around here

We lean back and we clink our glasses \\
Raise the drinks to our thirsty mouths, thick as molasses \\
Ice cold vodka eases in \\
As the low-pressure system brings the breezes in \\
And they sashay and pirouette above you \\
The only thing I know is that I love you \\
And I'm holding on \\
Yeah

[^incipiensjohn]:
    "It's a love song, kind of." --- CBGB, New York, July 23, 1999

    Pronounced with a hard C: in-KIP-ee-ens. John explains that this is
    probably affected, but does it anyway. Bottom of the Hill, San Francisco,
    June 23, 2011; Swedish-American Hall, San Francisco, June 27, 2012.

    With *incipiens* meaning "beginning" in Latin, it is the first song in the
    Alpha series, confirmed at the Swedish-American Hall, San Francisco, June
    27, 2012.

[^incipiensseries]:
    Alpha Incipiens is part of the [Alpha couple series](series.html#alpha).

## Azo Tle Nelli in Tlalticpac? [^azotlejohn] [^azotleseries] [^flowersong] ## {#azotle}

I was sitting in the street \\
When the news came my way \\
I was sitting in the street \\
When the news came my way \\
Good news \\
Good news \\
Good news \\
Good news

I was sitting in the street \\
When the messenger came by \\
I was sitting in the street \\
When the messenger came my way \\
Good news \\
Good news like a rare blood disorder \\
Good news \\
Good news

I was sitting in the street \\
I don't believe I've made it clear what exactly I mean by that \\
I was sitting in the middle of the street \\
The dust made its way to my legs even though my shirt was tucked in, and I saw \\
Colors forming in the west \\
Saw the bright feathers reflected in the sky \\
And now good news \\
Good news \\
Good news \\
Good news

[^azotlejohn]:
    "\[This song\] took its title from an Aztec poem, it's called 'Azo Tle
    Nelli in Tlalticpac?', which I'm probably pronouncing wrong, but as I
    understood it then, it was a formulaic thing that was said at the end of
    some religious poems... \[meaning\] 'is that the only thing in the
    world?' It's about the apocalypse." --- Hopscotch, Durham, September 8,
    2012

[^azotleseries]:
    Azo Tle Nelli in Tlalticpac? is part of the [informal series of Aztec
    songs](series.html#aztec).

[^flowersong]:
    Taken from an old Nahuatl poem, called Xochicuicatl, meaning Flower Song.
    The verse in question reads:

    Noyuh quichihua con teuctlon timaloa yecan quetzalmaquiztla
    matilolticoya conahuiltia icelteotlhuia achcanon azo a yan ipalnemoa
    achcanon azo tle nel in tlalticpac ohuaya.

    Translated:

    Thus do the nobles glorify themselves with things of beauty, honor
    and delight, that they may please the one only god, though one knows
    not the dwelling of the Giver of Life, one knows not whether he is on
    earth.

## Alpha Sun Hat [^sunhatseries] ## {#sunhat}

You say again that nothing's wrong \\
I'd really like to play along \\
Your ruby-red mouth is full and moist \\
I'd like to give in to your oboe-reed voice \\
But as sure as those are buzzards in the guava tree \\
You're looking real funny at me

One, two, three, four \\
That's not music you hear, that's the devil \\
That's not the sun up in the sky, it's a human heart \\
If you're planning your escape, you know I'm all for ya \\
As I watch the sun come up again over Tallahassee, Florida

## The Black Ice Cream Song [^icecreamyamaraja] ## {#icecream}

And the heat came down \\
And the heat came down \\
I knew I was living in a long, long dream \\
When you fed me the black ice cream

And the heat rose up \\
And the heat rose up \\
I heard the loud, loud buzzing of our son's go-kart \\
And the ice cream was blacker than the devil's heart \\
It was August the 19th \\
1957 \\
Fixed my eyes on you \\
Fixed my eyes on you

[^icecreamyamaraja]:
    An [alternate version](series.html#demos) of The Black Ice Cream Song
    exists, in which John, pretending to be someone else as the band the
    Yamaraja Racers, covers the song himself. The song was released on a
    tribute tape to the Mountain Goats, by an English fan who would prefer not
    to be named, called A Postcard to the Mountain Goats, on the Baccanalian
    Revel label. It was rereleased on a collection of the two Yamaraja Racers
    songs, also on Baccanalian Revel.

    One other Yamaraja Racers cover exists, [Chanson du Bon
    Chose](nbp.html#chanson).

## Sinaloan Milk Snake Song ## {#sinaloan}

*"Everybody ready?" "Uh, yeah!" "Mm-hm."*

Sun melts everything down \\
And the hills are reduced to nothing \\
The whole house shakes \\
And you can see that the coach is coming \\
You lean down and you pick up the small soft eggs \\
In the dust outside my door \\
I hold them in my hands \\
They are warm and the air is warming up now

I've got a message for you \\
If I could only remember \\
I've got a message for you \\
But you're gonna have to come and get it

La la la la la la la la \\
La la la la la la la

Ever since I came here \\
All I could think about is water \\
Last night they brought the fat lamb in from the fold \\
But I couldn't bring myself to do anything about it \\
I remember California \\
I remember Malibu [^malibu] \\
I remember the states and the names of the cities \\
But I don't remember you

And I've got a message for you \\
If I could only remember \\
I've got a message for you \\
But you're gonna have to come and get it
I've got a message for you \\
I've got a message for you

Two, three, four \\
La la la la la la la la \\
La la la la la la la la \\
La la la la la la la la \\
La la la la la la la la \\
Yeah \\
Woo, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup \\
Whee \\
Ah

[^malibu]:
    [Malibu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu,_California) is a wealthy
    city on the California coast in Los Angeles.

## We Have Seen the Enemy [^pogo] ## {#enemy}

Everything I've told you is true \\
So imagine my surprise when I blink my eyes \\
And realize that I've been talking to you \\
And I've told you everything \\
Even the parts I'd meant to leave out \\
And I shake my hair \\
And I look about

And the wild dogs are hungry \\
And the wild dogs howl \\
And the wild dogs in the mountains to the north of us \\
Come down

[^pogo]:
    A likely reference to the famous Pogo quotation, "[Yep, son, we have met
    the enemy and he is
    us](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogo_%28comic_strip%29#.22We_have_met_the_enemy_and_he_is_us..22)",
    stated by Pogo in an Earth Day comic as he is disgusted by our destruction
    of the Earth. Walt Kelly, the author of Pogo, was himself referencing a
    commander from the War of 1812, who stated, "We have met the enemy, and
    they are ours."

## Standard Bitter Love Song \#7 [^sbls7series] ## {#sbls7}

You smile at me in total defiance of all decency \\
You got it down to a science, that innocent look \\
You got it practiced real good \\
But I know you'd kill me if you could stand the sight of blood \\
If I'd been a fly on the wall a little earlier \\
If I'd been one of the innumerable flies in this room \\
If I'd been a fly on the wall a little earlier \\
It would've been real different around here

And you try to speak, but the buzzing's too loud \\
And it's hard to make you out through the dense black cloud \\
That surrounds us both, that's just as well \\
You call them up, let the whole house go to hell \\
If I'd have been one of these flies \\
I would have lodged myself firmly underneath your eyelid \\
If I'd have been one of these flies a little earlier \\
It would've been real different around here

## Quetzalcoatl Eats Plums [^plumsseries] [^quetzalcoatl] ## {#plums}

I meant to leave the house this morning \\
And begin making my way toward where you are \\
I meant to leave the house this morning \\
I made it halfway across the front yard

But the plum tree hung heavy in my head \\
And the plum tree hung heavy in my heart \\
And the plum tree hung heavy over me

So I tore off to the phone \\
To call you and tell you something, but I couldn't remember what \\
Because through the clean, clean windows \\
Saw the plum tree's leaves as red as fresh blood

But the plum tree hung heavy in my head \\
And the plum tree hung heavy in my heart \\
And the plum tree hung heavy over me

[^plumsseries]:
    Quetzalcoatl Eats Plums is part of the [informal series of Aztec

    is a creator god, credited with making the fifth incarnation, or 'sun', of
    humanity, which was considered to be the present era. He was additionally
    considered to be the deity who [provided human beings with
    maize](#fn:maize) and the calendar, among other gifts.

## Orange Ball of Love [^ballofloveseries] ## {#balloflove}

When I catch sight of your face \\
And the late light falling on it \\
I feel scared and I scope the area out \\
For a good place to hide

When I feel the way your fingers \\
Wiggle in my palm \\
I feel warm and I feel good \\
Inside

And I know that you're wearing a wire \\
And as the sun becomes a blazing orange ball of fire \\
I lose interest in this \\
And other such inconsequential questions

When you kick off your shoes \\
And I see the wet grass give way underneath your feet \\
And the sunset soars up once more over its burial ground \\
Well, you look so sweet

And I know you'll be turning me in \\
But I also know your real name's not Amy Lynn \\
And as the orange globe rears up to swallow us too \\
I see you look at me to figure out what I know about you \\
Well, I'm not telling \\
I'm not telling you anything

    Orange Ball of Love is part of the [Orange Ball of ...
    series](series.html#orangeball).

## Orange Ball of Hate [^hatejohn] [^hateseries] ## {#hate}

When I hear the screeching weather vane \\
In the wild wind and the pissing rain \\
I know that one of us, I'm not saying who \\
Has got rocks in her head, the rain comes through \\
The open window, but you don't think so \\
I sure do love you \\
I sure do love you

When I notice that the radio is broken \\
And I see you standing there in the doorway soaking [^smoking] \\
The water drizzles off of you down to the floor \\
And I say that I don't want to live in New England anymore \\
Some flower petals stick to your skin \\
I grab hold of your hip and I pull you in

When the building establishes control \\
When the thunder from the north begins to roll \\
Down our way, I know I've been right all along \\
And you start singing that stupid children's song \\
You think I don't know it, but I just don't feel like singing it \\
I sure do love you \\
I sure do love you

[^hatejohn]:
    "If you wanted this for the wrong personal reasons, I hope they get
    better. --- Zoop II, Farm Sanctuary, New York, June 14, 2009

    "This is a song that takes place in California... it's about that moment in
    which you know it's not going to get any better, but you're going to prove
    to somebody just exactly how strong you are." --- Cow Haus, Tallahassee,
    February 6, 1998

    "It's about the point at which in a dissolving relationship the line

## Bad Priestess ## {#priestess}

When I see you in your new blue jeans \\
I know you're lying \\
And I know what it means \\
When I see you take your place among the poor \\
I know you're a fraud for sure \\
Bad priestess \\
Bad priestess

So the sunlight plays its games along your eyes \\
And it has the same effect on a thousand other guys \\
And I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel the pull too \\
But the sunlight makes me strong and I know about you \\

On a Thursday as the sun goes does \\

## Going to Bristol [^bristolseries] [^bristol] ## {#bristol}

I looked you up and down \\
I liked everything I saw \\
From the fragile outline of your hips \\
To the trembling movements in your jaw \\
But then the coffee cup shattered on the kitchen floor \\
You said that you couldn't take it anymore \\
I knew you were leaving \\
I knew you were going to Bristol

I watched you pack your bags \\
Saw you head up to the door \\
But when the key broke off in the deadbolt lock \\
You said that you couldn't take it anymore \\
That was the second time you said that in one day \\
Why don't you just sit still, it's going to be OK \\

## Young Caesar 2000 [^caesar] ## {#caesar}

When I was twelve years old \\
They put me on the throne \\
When I was twelve years old \\
They made me king \\
From the ocean south of here to the northern hemisphere \\
They made me everything \\
Now I'm thirteen \\
And no one takes me seriously \\
Now I'm thirteen \\
And they're trying to take away control \\
I don't know how stupid \\
You all think I am \\
But as sure as flowers grow along the western wall \\
Heads are gonna roll \\
Yeah

[^caesar]:
    I cannot find a Caesar whose biography matches this story, so I am
    guessing that this is using [Caesar metaphorically as a
    title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_(title)), rather than
    referring to a specific Caesar.

## Going to Lebanon [^lebanonseries] [^lebanon] ## {#lebanon}

I saw your arms hanging at your side \\
Nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide \\
Saw you moving, real slow \\
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to go \\
I heard the wind blow \\
I saw your sash come untied \\
Blue water, white sky

Up in the cedars we were too far away \\
For the radio to tell us the time of day \\
But there was moisture in the air \\
And I heard the city call \\
They could go on burning \\
To hell with them all \\
Your liquid movements \\
The water rushing by \\
Blue water, white sky

World's surface was as smooth as glass \\
They saw the hour coming and they didn't let it pass \\
I heard you say my name twice through your teeth \\
I saw you coming down to me, I was underneath you \\
It's been coming for some time \\
You close your eyes \\
Blue water, white sky

I heard the wind blow \\
I saw your sash come untied \\
Blue water, white sky

## Grendel's Mother [^beowulf] ## {#grendel}

The cave mouth shines \\
By pure force of will \\
I look down on the world \\
From the top of this lonesome hill \\
And you can run \\
And run some more \\
From here all the way to Singapore [^singapore] \\
But I will carry you home in my teeth

In the great hall you drink red wine \\
You chew meat off the bone \\
I beat down a new path to the castle \\
I come naked and alone \\
I laid my son on the bier, I burned the wreath \\
Fire overhead, water underneath [^funeral] \\
And you can stand up, or you can run \\
You and I both know what you've done \\
And I will carry you home \\
I will carry you home \\
I will carry you home in my teeth

    anonymously-authored Old English poem written between the 8th and 11th
    centuries. In the poem, the Scandinavian hero, Beowulf, slays Grendel, a
    monster attacking Beowulf's Danish allies. Grendel's mother then attacks
    their hall as well, dying in the attempt. Upon returning home and being
    crowned king, Beowulf dies after killing a dragon.

    This chronicles Grendel's mother's mourning of Grendel.

## Song for Tura Satana [^turaseries] [^turasatana] ## {#tura}

Doll Squad's at the drive-in [^dollsquad] \\
It's 1973 \\
And the fruit is full and fat this year on the orange trees \\
Which grow in clusters \\
The city's 60 miles away \\
As the sunset tries desperately \\
To break through the gray \\
And the stardust \\
Came down \\
Royal blue \\
As the San Bernardino sky [^sanbernardino] \\
Showered over you

Coming home early \\
Is always a mistake \\
But when see that woman on the sofa \\
Something in you breaks \\
You got a celluloid tendency to flare out and blaze \\
And the report sounds once like a failed hymn of praise \\
And the stardust \\
Came down \\
Royal blue \\
As the San Bernardino sky \\
Showered over you

## Alpha in Tauris [^taurisjohn] [^taurisseries] [^tauris] ## {#tauris}

My hand brushes against the lock of hair that hangs down past your ear to your jaw \\
My hand brushes against the lock of hair that hangs down past your ear to your jaw \\
It's real neat \\
The moment's sweet but it's all wrong

And we're pictures of decency when we wave goodbye outside \\
We're pictures of decency when we wave goodbye outside \\
Yeah, I'm the model of composure out there \\
But you oughta see me shaking later on

My brain gets flooded six hours later \\
My brain gets flooded over six hours later \\
And rivers run with pictures of you as I stare up at the blood-red moon \\
Lying out front on the lawn \\
Hey

[^tauris]:
    Most likely an allusion to [*Iphigenia in
    Tauris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_in_Tauris), a dramatic
    play by [Euripides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides). In his
    previous play, [*Iphigenia in
    Aulis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_in_Aulis), Agamemnon is
    ordered by the goddess Diana's oracle to sacrifice his daughter,
    Iphigenia, so that he can be victorious against the Scythians. While
    Agamemnon believes the sacrifice to be completed, Diana rescued Iphigenia
    from the altar, placing her as Diana's priestess in Tauris, Scythia.
    *Iphigenia in Tauris* resumes the story with Iphigenia being pressured to
    sacrifice two Greeks in retribution for her own attempted sacrifice. As
    she discovers one to be her brother, she helps with their escape, becoming
    the priestess of Artemis at Brauron.

    An encore staple for the band, John has played this song many, many times
    live. There is a fantastic authorship story in which John was robbed on
    his way to buy cigarettes at a gas station on Christmas Eve, two days
    before writing the song, and was therefore unable to buy cigarettes, hence
    the aggression in the lyrics. Letters to Santa, Chicago, December 7, 2011.

    In recent years, he has repudiated the song for its purported misogynistic
    streak. "I don't play 'Going to Georgia' any more because I can't really
    reconcile how buoyant it is with how much I dislike its narrator --- when
    I wrote it, I enjoyed that tension, but I was more of an aesthete then and
    now I think more with my gut. My gut tells me the whole deal with 'Going
    to Georgia' is bogus, so that's that. A better song would be one from the
    perspective of the person whose former partner has shown up on the porch
    of his/her house with a damn gun, that's the hero of the song whose story
    is more interesting from where I'm at now. " William Caxton Fan Club, [At

[^bornseries]:
    Quetzalcoatl Is Born is part of the [informal series of Aztec
    songs](series.html#aztec).

[^quetzalcoatlbirth]:
    There are several versions of the myth of Quetzalcoatl's birth. Among
    these stories are that he was the son of the goddess Chimalman after she
    "swallowed a precious green stone". Another states that he was "the son of
    a mother who already has four thousand children who have left her and now
    form the stars of the Milky Way". Saddened by the loss of her children to
    the stars, she wept, and the god Onteotl pitied her and gave her a sacred
    quetzal feather, which impregnated her with the twins of Quetzalcoatl
    ("the greatest of her children") and "his dark twin brother,
    Tezcatlipoca". As Quetzalcoatl is identified with the planet Venus, his
    second version explained why the stars flee when Venus, the morning star,
    rose, heralding the day.

    Yet another version is that during a battle between the Toltecs and the
    Chichimecas, Chimalman disguised herself as a Toltec soldier and visited
    Mixcoatl, the god and chief of the Toltecs, whom she loved. Mixcoatl
    mistakenly believed her to be from the Chichimecas, and so shot her with
    four arrows. One of these pierced her womb, impregnating her with the
    child Quetzalcoatl, then dying in childbirth. These stories blend a
    narrative of Quetzalcoatl as a deity and being a great, but human, hero
    and leader of the Toltecs.

    None of those stories seem to be what this song describes, however. For
    that, [see below](#fn:sunandmoon).

[^sunandmoon]:
    This story is a retelling of the creation of the 'fifth sun' in Aztec
    mythology. (The Aztecs considered themselves to be living in the era of
    the fifth sun.) Documented by Uruguayan journalist and writer [Eduardo
    Galeano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Galeano) as *El sol y la
    luna* (*The sun and the moon*), one version of the myth is as follows:

    > Al primer sol, el sol de agua, se lo llevó la inundación. Todos los que en
    > el mundo moraban se convirtieron en peces.
    >
    > Al segundo sol lo devoraron los tigres.
    >
    > Al tercero lo arrasó una lluvia de fuego, que incendió a las gentes.
    >
    > Al cuarto sol, el sol de viento, lo borró la tempestad. Las personas se
    > volvieron monos y por los montes se esparcieron.
    >
    > Pensativos, los dioses se reunieron en Teotihuacán.
    >
    > ---¿Quién se ocupará de traer el alba?
    >
    > El Señor de los Caracoles, famoso por su fuerza y su hermosura, dio un
    > paso adelante.
    >
    > --- Yo seré el sol ---dijo.
    >
    > ---¿Quién más?
    >
    > Silencio.
    >
    > Todos miraron al Pequeño Dios Purulento, el más feo y desgraciado de los
    > dioses, y decidieron:
    >
    > ---Tú.
    >
    > El Señor de los Caracoles y el Pequeño Dios Purulento se retiraron a los
    > cerros que ahora son las pirámides del sol y de la luna. Allí, en ayunas,
    > meditaron.
    >
    > Después los dioses juntaron leña, armaron una hoguera enorme y los
    > llamaron.
    >
    > El Pequeño Dios Purulento tomó impulso y se arrojó a las llamas. En
    > seguida emergió, incandescente, en el cielo.
    >
    > El Señor de los Caracoles miró la fogata con el ceño fruncido. Avanzó,
    > retrocedió, se detuvo. Dio un par de vueltas. Como no se decidía, tuvieron
    > que empujarlo. Con mucha demora se alzó en el cielo. Los dioses, furiosos, lo
    > abofetearon. Le golpearon la cara con un conejo, una y otra vez, hasta que
    > le mataron el brillo. Así, el arrogante Señor de los Caracoles se convirtió
    > en la luna. Las manchas de la luna son las cicatrices de aquel castigo.
    >
    > Pero el sol resplandeciente no se movía. El gavilán de obsidiana voló
    > hacia el Pequeño Dios Purulento:
    >
    > ---¿Por qué no andas?
    >
    > Y respondió el despreciado, el maloliente, el jorobado, el cojo:
    >
    > ---Porque quiero la sangre y el reino.
    >
    > Este quinto sol, el sol del movimiento, alumbró a los toltecas y alumbra a
    > los aztecas. Tiene garras y se alimenta de corazones humanos.

    Translated by Frank Thomas Smith, this reads:

    > The first sun, the water sun, was carried off by the flood. All who
    > lived in the world were turned into fishes.
    >
    > The second sun was devoured by tigers.
    >
    > The third was destroyed by a firestorm, which burned up the people.
    >
    > The fourth sun, the wind sun, was wiped away by the storm. The people
    > turned into monkeys and scattered in the woods.
    >
    > Deep in thought, the gods met in Teotihuacán.
    >
    > "Who will take care of bringing the dawn?"
    >
    > The Lord of the Snails, famous for his strength and beauty, stepped
    > forward.
    >
    > "I will be the sun," he said.
    >
    > "Who else?
    >
    > Silence.
    >
    > The all looked at Little God Purulent, the ugliest and unluckiest of the
    > gods, and they decided:
    >
    > "You."
    >
    > The Lord of the Snails and Little God Purulent retired to the hills,
    > which are now the pyramids of the sun and of the moon. There, fasting,
    > they mediated.
    >
    > Then the gods gathered firewood, built an enormous bonfire, and called
    > them.
    >
    > The Little God Purulent braced himself and jumped into the flames. He
    > immediately emerged incandescent in the sky.
    >
    > The Lord of the Snails looked frowning at the fire. He advanced,
    > retreated, stopped. He turned around a few times. As he didn't make up
    > his mind, they had to push him. After much delay he rose into the sky.
    > Furious, the gods slapped his face. They hit his face with a rabbit,
    > again and again, until they killed his brightness. Thus, the arrogant
    > Lord of the Snails became the moon. The stains on the moon are the scars
    > of that punishment.
    >
    > But the resplendent sun did not move. The sparrow hawk of obsidian
    > (lava) flew to the Little God Purulent:
    >
    > "Why don't you move?"
    >
    > And the despised, the purulent, the hunchback, the cripple, answered:
    >
    > "Because I want the blood and the kingdom."
    >
    > This fifth sun, the sun of movement, illuminated the Toltecs and
    > illuminates the Aztecs. It has claws and feeds on human hearts.

    The Lord of Snails is also translated as the Lord of Shells, and was
    originally called Tecuciztecatl, and the Little God Purulent as the Small
    Syphilitic God, originally Nanahuatzin. This story demonstrates how in the
    Aztec and Toltec cosmology, the despised and miserable can rise through
    courage and sacrifice, and the beautiful and wealthy can destroy
    themselves through arrogance and cowardice.

[^sonora]:
    [Sonora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonora) is one of the
    northwesternmost states of Mexico. It contains the large [Sonoran
    Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoran_Desert), which spans from
    Sonora through Baja California, Baja California Sur, and up into the
    United States in southern California and Arizona.

    [Sonora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonora, California) is also a town
    in California, the county seat of Tuolumne County, located near Yosemite
    National Park, and being on the route to Sonora Pass, an important pass
    across the Sierra Nevada north of Tioga Pass Road in Yosemite.

[^you]:
    Given that the 'you' in the song appears to jump first, is said to "take
    on divinity", and the Lord of the Snails is named separately, I believe
    the 'you' is the Little God Purulent [mentioned above](#fn:sunandmoon).

[^maize]:
    Quetzalcoatl, as [mentioned above](#fn:quetzalcoatl), gave the gift of
    maize, or corn, to the Aztec people in Aztec mythology. As the Irish
    folklorist Padraic Colum retells the story:

    > There was a time when they did not have maize, when they lived upon
    > roots and on what they gained in the chase. Maize there was, but it was
    > hidden within a mountain, and no one could come to where it was.
    > Different gods had tried to rend the mountain apart that they might come
    > to where the maize was; but this could not be done. Then Quetzalcoatl
    > took the form of a black ant; with a red ant to guide him he went within
    > the mountain Tonacatepetl, and he came to where the maize was: he took
    > the grain, and laboriously he bore it back to men. Then men planted
    > fields with maize; they had crops for the first time; they built cities,
    > and they lived settled lives, and Quetzalcoatl showed them all the
    > crafts that they could learn from him. They honoured him who dwelt in
    > the shining house.
