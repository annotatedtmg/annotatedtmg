[^shortwave]:
    [Shortwave radio][] uses frequencies from the top of the AM band to the
    bottom of the VHF band (just below FM). The main advantage of shortwave is
    its long-distance transmission capabilities. It is used for a variety of
    purposes, including general commercial broadcasting, amateur radio, ship
    and aircraft communication, international propaganda, utility stations,
    radio clocks, and numbers stations.

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

Up the Punx [^punx]

[^punx]:
    Seems to have multiple meanings depending on who is asked, and doesn't
    have one fixed definition. The best descriptivist definition I could come
    up with is that this phrase is used by punks to jokingly make fun of
    overenthusiasm in the punk scene, for genuine enthusiasm, or to ridicule
    people not considered to be in line with the punk ethos. See for example
    the Bomb the Music Industry! song (Shut) Up the Punx!

## Crows ## {#crows}

Well, I went way out North Carolina way \\
To that old graveyard where my great-grandmother lay \\
And the day was bright \\
And I hadn't slept all night \\
And they'd sold the place to some guys who were building graduate student housing

No one had raised any objections \\
They were knocking the headstones down \\
And the sun was high \\
When I rolled into town \\
Stood by a nameless hole in the ground \\
The air was sweet and hot \\
Maybe it was the right grave \\
Maybe not

But the crows, crows, crows \\
Rose, rose, rose from the grave \\
Yeah, the crows, crows, crows, \\
Rose, rose, rose from the grave

## Genesis 19: 1 -- 2 [^genesisseries] [^genesistitle] ## {#genesis}

The girl who'd been haunting your dreams all your life \\
The butcher from Brooklyn, the butcher's wife \\
The girl who kissed you in the seventh grade \\
Her and all the others lined up behind the gate \\
The two angels came to Sodom in the evening[^twoangels] \\
When the sun up in the sky was bleeding all over you

And you had your camera \\
And you had your felt tip [^felttip] \\
And you had some money \\
And you had everything you needed \\
The two angels came to Sodom in the evening \\
They saw you coming up the boulevard \\
The two angels came to Sodom in the evening \\
When the sun up in the sky was bleeding all over you

[^genesisseries]:
    Genesis 19: 1 -- 2 is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^genesistitle]:
    "The two angels entered Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting at Sodom's
    gate. When Lot saw them, he got up to meet them. He bowed with his face to
    the ground and said, "My lords, turn aside to your servant's house, wash
    your feet, and spend the night. Then you can get up early and go on your
    way."

    "No," they said. "We would rather spend the night in the square." [Genesis
    19: 1 -- 2][genesis1912], Holman Christian Standard Bible, retrieved March
    22, 2013.

[genesis1912]: http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2019:1-2&version=HCSB

[^twoangels]:
    This is the opening phrase in the Biblical verse referenced in the title.
    Genesis 19 describes the destruction of [Sodom and Gomorrah][] for their
    sin, particularly regarding what was considered sexual deviancy (including
    a crowd insisting that Lot provide the two angels to them that they might
    have sex with them). In the Bible, Sodom and Gomorrah were ultimately
    destroyed by fire and brimstone sent by God, and Lot fled Sodom, during
    which his wife was turned into a pillar of salt for looking back at the
    destroyed city.

[^felttip]: My best guess is that this refers to a permanent marker.

## Yoga ## {#yoga}

We had our passports out and the kids to fix them up with \\
And the hurricane lamp threw our shadows on the ceiling \\
I watched them box with one another up there, Punch and Judy [^punchandjudy] \\
It was lovely, it was awful, it was that kind of feeling \\
When you said, it was real sure, that there was nothing standing in our way \\
And the lie ran off and hid itself in the alleys all across Bombay [^bombay]

I saw you knock the lamp over while reaching for the scissors \\
And I wondered how we'd ever get by without it \\
And you fell into my arms then, sweet and gentle \\
Poison in the water, little doubt about it \\
And you said that one of us would be all alone someday \\
And the truth of it echoed inexhaustibly up and down the thoroughfares all across Bombay

[^punchandjudy]:
    [Punch and Judy][punchwiki] is a traditional puppet show depicting the
    violent Mr. Punch, Judy, his wife, and other characters.

## Dirty Old Town [^dirtyoldtownseries] [^dirtyoldtown] ## {#town}

I found my love \\
By a gasworks croft [^croft] \\
Dreamed a dream \\
By the old canal \\
I kissed my girl \\
By the factory wall \\
Dirty old town \\
Dirty old town

The moon is shifting \\
Behind a cloud \\
Cats are crawling \\
All along the beat \\
And springs a girl \\
In the streets at night \\
Dirty old town \\
Dirty old town

Heard a siren \\
Calling from the docks \\
Saw a train \\
Set the night on fire \\
I smelled the spring \\
On the smoky wind \\
Dirty old town \\
Dirty old town

I'm going to make \\
A good sharp axe \\
Shining steel \\
Tempered in the fire \\
Will chop you down \\
Like an old dead tree \\
Dirty old town \\
Dirty old town

## Commandante [^commjohn] [^commdef] ## {#comm}

I'm gonna drink more whiskey than Brendan Behan [^behan] \\
I'm gonna send my belongings all to Tripoli [^tripoli] \\
And I'm gonna ride home to California \\
With a banjo on my knee [^susanna]

I'm never gonna to turn off the television \\
I'm just gonna let it run all night \\
I'm gonna plant root vegetables out in the back yard and \\
Come summer I am going to treat you right, so

Put on your Chairman Mao coat [^maocoat] \\
And let me clear my throat \\
Let's turn this whole town upside down \\
Shake it till the coins come falling out of its pocket, yeah \\
Put on your Che Guevara pin [^che] \\
Call the troops on in \\
We're gonna sail through the night sky like a pair of bottle rockets [^bottlerocket] [^altchorus]

I got a great big secret written down somewhere \\
I got a rosary to protect us both from harm \\
I got a storage locker full of cow figurines \\
And a laundry list of grievances longer than my arm \\
And I am never going back to Cincinnati [^cincinnati] \\
All those bridges have been burned down to the ground \\
I got the jet pack strapped to my back \\
And I'm waiting for you to come around, yeah

Put on your Chairman Mao coat \\
And let me clear my throat \\
Let's turn this whole place upside down, yes \\
Shake it till the coins come falling out of its pockets, yeah \\
Put on your Che Guevara pin \\
Call the troops on in \\

[^commjohn]:
    John has described this as an "upbeat song about \[a\] couple consuming
    one another". January 27, 1999, Cat's Cradle, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

[^commdef]:
    "Comandante" means "commander" in Spanish, and
    "[commandant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commandant)" is a military
    title whose precise meaning depends on the military in question. I do not
    know if John misspelled these words or if he meant something else.

    "[Hasta Siempre,
    Comandante](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasta_Siempre,_Comandante)", is a
    song written by Cuban Carlos Manuel Puebla celebrating Che Guevara,
    mentioned later in the song. This may or may not have some relationship to
    John's choice of title.

[^behan]:
    [Brendan Behan][behanwiki] was an Irish writer, playwright, Irish
    Republican Army member, and notorious alcoholic who wrote Borstal Boy, an
    autobiography about being an Irish Republican and his subsequent
    imprisonment in the late 1930s and early 1940s while an adolescent. He
    ultimately died of diabetes secondary to alcohol abuse.

    song ["Oh! Susanna"][susannawiki], written by Stephen Foster in 1848.

[^maocoat]:
    Mao Zedong, communist revolutionary and founding father of the People's
    Republic of China, was known for wearing a [collared coat with four
    pockets][maocoatwiki], which became symbolic of Chinese communism.

[^che]:
    [Che Guevara][chewiki] was a Marxist from Argentina known for his

    *Guerrillero Heroico*, has gained worldwide renown and has become a symbol
    of revolution, often placed on pins and t-shirts.

[^bottlerocket]:
    A [bottle rocket][bottlerocketwiki] is a generally illegal small firework
    intended to be fired into the sky, where it makes a small explosion.
    Initially, it is often placed in a small glass bottle to stablize it while
    it is lit.

[^altchorus]:
    This chorus has also been sung with the chorus lines of "Lace up your
    skates real good / Come on over to my neighborhood", "Put on your Chairman
    Mao hat / You look so goddamn cute in that", "Lace up your skates real
    tight / Be here by six o'clock tonight". See the Cat's Cradle show on
