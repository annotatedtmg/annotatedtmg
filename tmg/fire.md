### Liner notes ### {#liner}

The Mountain Goats are John and Rachel. These songs were recorded Winter
1995-96 by Bob DURKEE: thanks, Bob. Thanks also to Dan, and to the infectious
monkey, who only wanted to help.

In theory, if we who presently claim to be human were to forget our efforts to
find the traces of divine movements in our own actions, our fate should be
something like the people in the Popol Vuh. [^popol] For them, the forgotten
force of divinity reasserted itself by inhabiting their own tools and
utensils, which rose up against them and drove them from their homes. Today
they are swinging through the trees. \\
--- Dennis TEDLOCK [^tedlock]

[^popol]:
    [Popol Vuh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popol_Vuh) is a collection of
    text regarding the mythology and history of the K'iche' Kingdom of
    Q'umarkaj in Guatemala, a group of Mayans which lasted from the 13th
    through early 16th centuries. The texts begin with describing the creation
    of the world, through prehistory, and up to the movements and family trees
    of some living tribes.

[^tedlock]:
    [Dennis Tedlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Tedlock) is a
    professor of English and Anthropology at the State University of New York
    at Buffalo. He specializes in North and Middle American Indians and
    translation. This particular quote is the concluding paragraph of the
    introduction to his multiple-award-winning translation of [*Popul
    Vuh*](#fn:popol).

    The wooden people in question are part of the creation story in *Popol
    Vuh*. The creator, Heart of Sky, creates the animals, then a failed
    creation of mud, then another of wood. The wood beings can move, but have
    no minds, hearts, or worship in them, and so Heart of Sky turns them into
    monkeys, as unsuccessful attempts to make humans.

## Pure Gold [^goldseries] ## {#gold}

*"One, two, three, four, one, two."*

Hey, don't touch the door [^twilightzone] \\
Because the door will surely kill you \\
I hear you saying that you don't see what I mean \\
Well, you better look again

Stop looking at the floor \\
'Cause the whole building's turning and turning and turning \\
And don't touch the door \\
Can't you see the door's burning

And all at once the street is filled with light \\
And all at once the street is filled with sound \\
When I hold you I know our number's being called somewhere \\
Let them come on down

[^twilightzone]:
    In the liner notes to Ghana, John writes:

    > To date nobody has spotted the pinball reference in one of these four
    > songs. I suppose that in order to catch it, you'd have to have spent
    > countless hours leaning up against a machine, occasionally swearing at it
    > or kicking it's legs in outrage, feeling your brain melding with the tiny
    > CPU in its belly as its cheap speakers spat out commands, suggestions and
    > taunts. I'll bet you thought I was going to give some other hint as to
    > which pinball machine it was, and I was, actually, but the machine said
    > not to tell.

    Unbelievably, [Tim Chevalier](http://catamorphism.org) actually figured
    this out! "Don't touch the door!" is a callout that precedes the first
    multiball in the [Twilight Zone pinball
    game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_Zone_(pinball)), released in
    1993\. Completing the gumball machine (which releases pinballs instead of
    gumballs) locks the first ball. Immediately after, the display shows an
    animated door and the message, "Beyond this door is a dimension of sound",
    referencing Rod Serling's opening narration for seasons 4 and 5 of the
    original [Twilight Zone television
    series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone_(1959_TV_series)).
    He says these lines as a floating, ghostly door rotates in space before
    opening:

    > You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another
    > dimension --- a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of
    > mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things
    > and ideas. You've just crossed over into... the *Twilight Zone*.

    After the first lock, [Robby the
    Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robby_the_Robot) (a character taken
    from the 1956 film *Forbidden Planet*) says, "Don't touch the door!" This
    phrase is repeated multiple times until multiball begins, followed by
    Serling stating, "You've just crossed into... the Twilight Zone."

    Thanks enormously to [Tim Chevalier](http://catamorphism.org) for somehow
    deducing this reference.

## Papagallo [^papagalloseries] [^papagallo] ## {#papagallo}

You were standing near the water \\
When the wind ripped through \\
Heard your throat open up like a champagne bottle \\
I heard the one perfect song pouring out of you \\
There was a darkening sky reflected on the river \\
There's no way of determining where we were \\
Low hills, colors gone crazy \\
You standing like a ghost with the water behind you \\
It's hard to grab a hold of something, sometimes \\
Like you need me to remind you

You were standing near the water \\
And I was looking at the water \\
And then you went down in the water \\
And the river began to boil \\
There was a minute when I thought I knew what you were about \\
And then you opened up your eyes and the Lord came out \\
Low hills, colors gone crazy \\
You rising from the water like a bird \\
You had a pure song possessing you from shoulder to hip \\
And I recognized every single word

[^papagallo]:

    flourishing, while many others are endangered or extinct.

## Song for John Davis [^johndavisseries] [^johndavis] ## {#johndavis}

The day we set sail from England \\
The wind behind us was fair \\
The day we set sail from England \\
There were smiling faces everywhere

And the snow came down on New Hampshire today \\
And the snow came down on New Hampshire today

The day we put the grain into the ground \\
There were smiling faces all around \\
And underneath the trees we'd planted when we landed

And when I was a child \\
I spoke with the language of a child \\
But when I became a man \\
I put away childish things [^corinthians]

And the snow came down on New Hampshire today \\
And the snow came down on New Hampshire today

## Stars Around Her ## {#stars}

I saw the darkness coming down \\
It posed no threat to me \\
I let the darkness ease its way around \\
It was every good thing I'd expected it would be \\
I saw you coming through the twisting vines outside \\
I saw the new moon collide \\
With the stars \\
Clustered around her

I saw the young fruit on the new lime \\
I felt your breath catch its rhythm \\
I heard your legs push away the tall, dry brush \\
I saw the moon and the stars and knew the secrets within them \\
I heard you saying my name into my ear \\
No one has to tell me why you've come here \\
'Cause I know, I know \\
I know
