    Talking about the record in the Bitter Melon Farm liner notes, John
    writes:

    > Actually, it was supposed to have been called Sons for Peter Hughes, and
    > was a controversial experiment in the conversion of sound into matter. I
    > said some incantations and boiled a bunch of aromatics in vinegar, and the
    > book said that the result should have been four genetically perfect
    > replicas of my friend Peter. He and I would then employ them as gardeners,
    > housekeepers, and so forth, freeing us up for the very important work that
    > lay ahead of us --- at the time we were involved in delicate contract
    > negotiations with the Vatican which were supposed to have resulted in an
    > official Papal bull proclaiming Exit House the official Inland Empire Band
    > of the Holy See until the final judgment, at which point the torch was to
    > have been passed on to either the Bux or the Crunch Sisters, I can't
    > remember which. Long story short: technical mixup ends with the spells on
    > digital audio tape rather than in the bowels of the nether regions; postal
    > mixup results in said tape winding up in Bremen, where Gregor Kessler,
    > chancellor pro tem of Germany and a keen businessman, sends the tape to
    > the Czech Republic, where it was pressed in a limited edition of 600, the
    > first hundred or so on red vinyl. The fade-out at the end of "No, I Can't"
    > was the idea of the nameless Czech engineer who, hearing the way we'd run
    > out of tape while recording the song, couldn't deal with it and so muscled
    > his way anonymously into history.

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

PETER HUGHES HAS BAILED ME OUT MORE TIMES THAN I CARE TO COUNT. Hi, it's us.
We recorded these four songs in early 1995 with the kind assistance of Bob
DURKEE. One of them we didn't write but we're not saying which. THAT'S HIM ON
THE COVER. HE MAY HAVE PROTESTANT BLOOD BUT THE MAN IS A SAINT. These are the
names of the songs: Seite Eins: [^german] Short Song About the 10 Freeway. No,
I Can't. Seite Zwei: [^german] Song for Dana Plato. The Sign. I HOPE HE GETS
EVERYTHING HE EVER WANTS OUT OF LIVE AND NEVER REGRETS ANYTHING. Gregor and
everybody else at GOAR [^goar] have been extremely helpful and patient with
us. Thanks, guys. ONE TIME HE DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO SAY ANYTHING. EVERYBODY
ELSE WAS SAYING SOMETHING AND IT WASN'T HELPING. PETER KNEW WHAT I NEEDED.
"No, I Can't" originally appeared on *Transmissions to Horace* in a markedly
different version. "Song for Dana Plato" takes place in Las Vegas, NV, closer
to downtown than the strip, [^theft] in case anyone's curious.  WHEREFORE
THESE SONGS ARE ALL FOR HIM, AND IF HE EVER COMES UP TO YOU AND TELLS YOU TO
GIVE HIM YOUR COPY, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO HAND IT OVER. The Mountain
Goats are John and Rachel. MAY THE ALMIGHTY GOD BESTOW MANIFOLD BLESSINGS ON
PETER AND THOSE HE LOVES. So long.

[^german]:
    These phrases mean "Side One" and "Side Two" in German.

[^goar]:
    [Goar](http://www.grunnenrocks.nl/label/g/goar.htm) was a German music
    magazine operating in the late 1980s through 1990s which released a 7"
    vinyl EP with many issues. The Mountain Goats released two songs on
    Goar #11 also in 1995, Creature Song and Pure Sound, sharing space with
    Refrigerator. Other than the release date, however, I'm not sure of a
    connection between the two EPs.

[^theft]:
    Referring to Dana Plato's arrest for robbing a video story in Las Vegas;

## Short Song About the 10 Freeway [^tenfreewayseries] [^i10] ## {#tenfreeway}

Evening came on like a big red wing \\
And the dying sun spilt its colors on everything \\
And as the night came on \\
You burst into song \\
And you scraped your car up against the guardrail

And God is present in the sweeping gesture \\
But the Devil is in the details [^details]

## Song for Dana Plato [^danaplatojohn] [^danaplatoseries] [^danaplato] ## {#danaplato}

Three month ride \\
Sticks in your mind as though the insides of your head were a big screen \\
Coming in on the evening wind \\
It's the unmistakable scent of Brilliantine [^brilliantine] \\
What kind of memory serves, what kind of world is it \\
Comes headlong at you and then swerves at the last possible second \\
It's this one \\
Yeah, it's this one

And it's easy to slow down \\
And it's easy to slow down \\
And it's easy just to lie out by the blue pools in the squinting sun and slow down \\
And it's easy to slow down

And in situations like these \\
It's sometimes useful to think of life as one long continuous evening \\
That never turns into night \\
Hey, hey

    "I wrote a song about \[Dana Plato\] when she was --- before she died a
    long, long time ago when she was just robbing Vegas drug stores, and --- I
    know, because it was funny, it was like former child star does what former
    child stars do and rob stuff --- and then she died in a trailer in
    Oklahoma and it was tragic and twenty years later her son followed her and
    this is called Tyler Lambert's Grave." --- Soho Restaurant, Santa Barbara,

    successful, and Dana Plato died, and I was sad." --- Variety Playhouse,

    "It is a song about a person who got lost, and, I think --- I'm pretty
    sure when I wrote it is was before she got completely lost and died." ---

[^danaplato]:
    [Dana Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Plato) was a former child
    star famous for playing Kimberley Drummond on the American sitcom
    Diff'rent Strokes. Plato was let go from the show when she became
    pregnant, as that didn't fit the producer's wholesome image for the show.
    She struggled with drug abuse and poverty for the rest of her life. Four
    years after this song was written, she committed suicide on May 8, 1999,
    overdosing on carisoprodol and alcohol in her trailer at the age of 34.
    Her son, Tyler Lambert, committed suicide the next year by shooting
    himself in the head on May 6, 2010, 25 years old.

    In [the liner notes](#liner), John mentions that the song takes place in
    Las Vegas, Nevada. Plato lived in Las Vegas for a short period of time,
    and was arrested there in 1991 for robbing a video store for less than
    $200 with a pellet gun.

*"I never get tired of this."*

I've got a new life \\
You would hardly recognize me \\
I'm so glad \\
How could a person like me \\
Care for you \\
Why should I bother \\
When you're not the one for me

I saw the sign \\
And it opened up my eyes \\
I saw the sign \\
Love is demanding \\
Without understanding \\
Yeah, I saw the sign \\
And it opened up my eyes \\
I saw the sign \\
And no one's gonna drag you up

Under the pale moon \\
For so many years I'd wonder \\
Who you are \\
How could a person like you \\
Bring me joy \\
Under the pale moon \\
Where I see a lot of stars [^stars]

I saw the sign \\
And it opened up my eyes \\
I saw the sign \\
Love is demanding \\
Without understanding \\
Yeah, I saw the sign \\
And it opened up my eyes \\
I saw the sign \\
And no one's gonna drag you up \\
To get into the light where you belong [^incomprehensible]

[^thesignjohn]:
    A favorite of fans, often shouted for at shows and sometimes closing them,
    now played sparingly. There are many tellings of the long story told about
    this song, here's part of one of them. Watch the video if you can, it
    contains the dance and it's wonderful.

    "I've really grown to hate this song. I mean, and I loved it so much,
    once... I heard it and like any reasonable person would, I said, 'Well,
    that's the greatest song of all time. I'm going to go buy that right now."
    ... Me and Rachel went on our first off-the-West-Coast tour; we played
    shows in Chicago and Columbus, it was a hell of a tour. And on the way
    from Columbus into Chicago, we heard The Sign on the radio, somebody got
    up and turned the station. And I said, 'What is wrong with you? Does God
    hate you or something? Has He not taught you how to love? Is that what's
    wrong with you? Is that why you changed the station just now, Liz?' 'Dude,
    you have to chill. I can just turn it back to the station.' 'We've already
    missed part of the song. You know, you can just fucking drop me off by the
    side of the road here and I'll starve to death now, now that you've ruined
    my life.' So she turned the song back, and \[I\] preached my gospel. I'm
    pretty convincing when I want to be, and so then we pulled off in Gary,
    Indiana, and bought the whole album on cassette. Put it into the tape deck
    --- just kept rewinding. Listened to it once, twice, three times, four
    times, five times, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. By the time we got into
    Chicago, we had choreographed a dance. I believe I can remember it." ---

    "Naw I'm burned out on it. Last couple times I'm playing it I'm like 'what
    is really the point of this? telling a joke everybody already knows?
    strollin' down those 90s-hits memory lane?'"
