And where am I? \\
My whole house is burning down \\
and all I do is stand on the lawn \\
and gaze at the fire \\
that beautiful woman leaping \\
from the window in her bright dress \\
Gregory ORR, The Fire Hydrant [^orr]

## New Chevrolet in Flames [^chevroletseries] ## {#chevrolet}

We were drinking Colorado Bulldogs [^bulldog] \\
When inspiration struck \\
And we knew it was high time \\
For us to change our own luck

We cracked a couple Coca-Colas open \\
Mixed 'em up with vodka and some coffee liqueur [^bulldog] \\
Poured in some cold milk raised our glasses high to old friends \\
My love for you is 98% pure

But the 2% that remains \\
Has fried the circuits in my brain

I got out my smoking jacket [^jacket] \\
You put on some fishnets and your smart black beret \\
We cut quite a figure in the mirror \\
And then we were on our way

Oh, would that you would kiss me \\
With the kisses of your mouth \\
'Cause your mouth is sweeter than wine [^solomon], and has \\
A more complicated history than the American South [^south]

As the evening took us in \\
You could have popped the tension with a safety pin

We went down to Pete Brown's Chevrolet [^petebrown] \\
'Cause Pete Brown can satisfy all your new car needs \\
We were nicely oiled by then \\
Our internal transponders picking up satellite feeds

From well-worn ancient places \\
Our eager young sales rep handed us the keys \\
We drove about three-quarters of a mile \\
All that's left for us now are moments like these

We parked behind the high school \\
Away from the light \\
And the flames climbed high into the night

[^chevroletseries]:
    New Chevrolet in Flames is also part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible) and [informal series of
    outtakes](series.html#outtakes).

[^bulldog]:
    A Colorado Bulldog is a trio cocktail made of vodka, Kahl√∫a, cream, and
    a small amount of Coca-Cola.

[^jacket]:
    As the name implies, a [smoking
    jacket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_jacket) is a jacket for use
    while smoking; traditionally made of velvet or other leisurely materials.

[^solomon]:
    A reference to the Song of Solomon 1:2, "Oh, that he would kiss me with
    the kisses of his mouth! For your love is more delightful than wine."
    [Song of Solomon
    1:2](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Song%20of%20Solomon%201:2&version=HCSB),
    Holman Christian Standard Bible, accessed July 10, 2013.

[^south]:
    Tallahassee, the destination and final residence of the Alpha couple, is
    located within the [American
    South](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States), often but not
    always defined as being the states south of the Mason-Dixon line.
    Associated strongly with the Confederacy which rebelled against the Union
    during the Civil War, and correspondingly with a history of slavery,
    agriculture, State's rights, racial conflicts, and many other issues,
    Southern history is complex and still developing.

[^petebrown]:
    I have not found a real car dealership owned by or named after a Pete
    Brown. However, Pete Brown is an [English
    poet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Brown) to whom John may be paying
    an homage.

## Design Your Own Container Garden [^containerseries] [^cd] ## {#container}

I took to the highway \\
Went out to Pico - Crenshaw [^picocrenshaw] \\
Old friends, old friends

I took to the highway \\
The highway took to me \\
Like a second skin

Rolled around in the evening \\
Circling like a buzzard \\
Trouble in mind

Excavating the space we left behind

Yes, I took trinkets with me \\
Left them by the crater \\
Here ghosts, old ghosts

Smelled all the chlorine \\
I took the low road [^lowroad] \\
Where the light was just right

Crawled around in the glowing \\
All-embracing wreckage \\
Sunburned and snowblind

Excavating the space we left behind

[^containerseries]:
    Design Your Own Container Garden is also part of the [informal series of
    outtakes](series.html#outtakes).

[^cd]:
    Design Your Own Container Garden was only available on the CD issue of See
    America Right.

[^picocrenshaw]:
    West Pico Boulevard and Crenshaw Boulevard is [an
    intersection](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=West+Pico+Boulevard+and+Crenshaw+Boulevard,+Los+Angeles,+CA)
    in the Mid-City district of Central Los Angeles. Both Pico and Crenshaw
    are major streets connecting dense commercial areas to residential areas.

[^lowroad]:
    Potentially a reference to the traditional Scottish song [The Bonnie Banks
    o' Loch
    Lomond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bonnie_Banks_o'_Loch_Lomond),
    which contains the chorus, "Oh, you'll take the high road / and I'll take
    the low road / And I'll get to Scotland before you".
