[^cover]:
    Come, Come to the Sunset Tree had multiple different covers. The cover
    depicted here is one of the two owned by Caliclimber ([see
    above](#credits)), but many others exist. The liner notes are the same,
    but the art painted on each album differs. This particular copy is #184 of
    the 1,000 printed. Many still remain which have yet to be painted and
    sold by John. Caliclimber's other copy is #660; you can see it on his

## High Doses \#2 ## {#doses}
<!-- God series -->
We all woke up that morning \\
Claw marks on our little faces \\
The dull thud from the treetops \\
The echo in the hollow places

Rose up high and lonely \\
Wringing my hands, grinding my teeth \\
All the triumph overhead \\
All the disaster underneath

Spat out my morning prayers \\
Desperate pleas and vicious lies \\
Felt the sunlight through the grating \\
Covered up my eyes

Woke up feeling awful \\
Shook my head to drive the ghosts away \\
This is just a flesh wound \\
And it will clear up any day

But the present I got planned for you pricks \\
Is gonna be a little harder to fix \\
Thank God for small favors \\
In high doses

Heard the voices through the air vents \\
Listen to them squeal \\
The great big world is out there \\
The hidden one beneath my heel

Called up my sister in Reseda \\
Left a message at the tone \\
All the points where contact fails us \\
All of the dead spots in the zone

And the acid in my throat \\
Every time I try to talk \\
The songs that keep me up at night \\
Standing on that solid rock

Rose up high and dry and lonely \\
Stumbled coming out the gate \\
This is just a paper cut \\
And it will scab over, just you wait

But the cuts that I'll shortly begin dealing out \\
Are gonna give you something to cry about \\
Thank God for small favors \\
In high doses

## The Day the Aliens Came ## {#aliens}

*"Hey, Mr. Hughes and Mr. Vanderslice. Uh, this is a new song I'm really
excited about, and uh, and so since I wrote it on my old Cort guitar instead
of the new one, I wanna play it on that just for purposes of --- 'cause I've
been writing it and so forth, so that's why it sounds a little beat up and
flat and everything because these strings are old and everything, so sorry
about that. Uh, it's in A. I think I'm tuned to an A. It should be called
'Hawaiian Feeling', but probably can't be called that. Um, OK, right. All
right."*

I will wake up at 6 AM again \\
And I will find my way to the front door \\
Like a soldier crawling through the smoking carnage \\
Smoldering bodies at my feet \\
I'd love to stick around, but I've got someone to meet \\
And I will put my best foot forward \\
And I'll thank God I made it out of there \\
On the day when my new friends come

I will present myself in my nice white tuxedo jacket \\
And I will look out at the day through my dark sunglasses \\
And take in the scene \\
The house behind me and the people in it \\
Will all go up like steam in just a minute \\
There's gonna be a redefining of some borders \\
And I will receive my orders \\
On the day when my new friends come

The rooftops and the sidewalks \\
Will all melt like plastic \\
And oh, friends, old friends, dear friends \\
I'm gonna look fantastic

There won't be any reason left to cry \\
'Cause there won't be any people left to cry for \\
My memory's gonna vaporize itself \\
And my Italian shoes, well, they will be to die for \\
I believe I can fly \\
Why don't you look up at me and wave goodbye \\
On the day when my new friends come
