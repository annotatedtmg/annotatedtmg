## Baltimore ## {#baltimore}

When I walked past the chain link fence \\
And the guard dog came forward to attack me \\
I knew you were coming home \\
I knew you were on your way back

Well, in Baltimore \\
You will find what you've been waiting for \\
In Baltimore \\
You will find what you've been waiting for

Just beyond the last of the sidewalk \\
Where the beach begins \\
I heard the airplanes announcing the apocalypse \\
Saw the 737s coming on in

Will you hold on for just a minute \\
Will you hold on while I catch my breath

Listen, in Baltimore \\
You'll uncover what you're digging for \\
In Baltimore, ah \\
You will find what you've been waiting for

## All Rooms Cable A/C Free Coffee ## {#cableac}

Wine and honey, lipstick and spit \\
You coming through the door with a cigarette lit \\
And I'm not supposed to think your death wish is cool \\
But then I see you knocking back tequilas by the pool

And I am the yellow rose \\
Growing near the ground waiting to climb something

Sweat and water, muscle and blood \\
Hints about as subtle as a flash flood \\
Sky over California all pink and white \\
Something's gonna happen somewhere tonight

I am the yellow rose \\
Growing near the ground waiting to climb something

Thunder, lightning, hot rain \\
Sweet smell of rotten grain \\
Holy basil, wolfsbane \\
Crows tapping on the window pane

I am the yellow, yellow rose \\
Growing near the ground waiting to climb something

## Ultra Violet ## {#ultraviolet}

Down on the gulf coast where they rock and roll \\
I leaned a little while up against a barber pole \\
Stood like that until the sun went down \\
Lost a quart of blood since Tuesday

Light in the doorways \\
Light up the streets of this town \\
Ultra Violet, Ultra Violet

And when they cut loose, you gotta stand back \\
You gotta reinforce the places that they're likely to attack \\
I spent the whole week down at St. Vincent de Paul's \\
Wholly immersed in prayer

And Ultra Violet, Ultra Violet

Down where the river rushes into the sea \\
I didn't let 'em get the best of me \\
I didn't let 'em take the very best part \\
The last lone bit of light left flickering in my heart

Ultra Violet, Ultra Violet \\
Ultra Violet, Ultra Violet

## Twelve Hands High ## {#twelve}

I know you never asked for my opinion \\
But I'd say that horse is crazy \\
I know what I think doesn't matter any more \\
But I'd say his mind is gone \\
And I know you know what I know \\
Even though you'd rather die than say it \\
I know you feel the same way \\
Or you wouldn't be sleeping on the lawn

I heard the hooves crack the window \\
Saw the body come through \\
Saw the big brown eyes flashing \\
I fell all over you \\
I got pressure bearing down on me

There was a reason why I came here \\
But I guess now it doesn't matter \\
I had a good, good, good, good reason \\
But I guess now you couldn't care \\
There is a certain kind of feeling that you get \\
When you're totally helpless \\
And there's a different world waiting for me \\
When I lift my head up from your thick, dark hair

I heard the hooves crack the window \\
Saw the body come through \\
Saw the big nostrils flaring \\
I fell all over you \\
I got pressure bearing down on me

I heard the hooves crack the window \\
Saw the body come through \\
Saw the big brown eyes flashing \\
I fell all over you \\
I got pressure bearing down on me

## The River Song ## {#river}

The little river is blue and long \\
I sat by the side of it as everything went wrong \\
I got a letter from the dry city's heart \\
You say the water distribution system's come all apart \\
And my place here's threatened but I had it on my mind \\
And your face was on the skyline so sweet and so kind

Let them come \\
Let 'em all come down \\
Let them take a good long look around \\
Let them see if my rivers won't suit them \\
Let them drown

The fish that swim there in the current \\
With their machine like faces should be no deterrent \\
They'll all come toward me but I won't move \\
I know where I stand, I have nothing to prove \\
Because I had it in my heart that you were walking by \\
And the little river's waters became our separate sky

So let them come \\
Let 'em all come down \\
Let them take a good long look around \\
Let them see if my rivers won't suit them \\
Let them drown

Because I had it in my heart that you were walking by \\
And the whole world dissolved leaving only you and I

So let them come \\
Let 'em all come down \\
Let them take a good long look around \\
Let them see if my rivers won't suit them \\
Let them drown

## Somebody Else's Parking Lot in Sebastopol ## {#sebastopol}

Outside the opera house in Sydney \\
I saw my life come crashing to its end \\
I cried out to the scale tipper \\
On whom all living things depend

Sweet strains of Guiseppe Verdi \\
Suffused the evening air \\
I wished I wished I wished that God would kill me \\
Instead of leaving me alone to see you standing there before me \\
That sad look on your face \\
You took me to so many places I never thought I'd go \\
That was the worst place

Yeah we did our manners proud \\
On the night we said goodbye \\
No big scenes out there on the sidewalk \\
As we pinpointed the place where all good things go to die

I know you hate it when I get my headaches \\
I got a real gem tonight \\
Listening to Katia Ricciarelli \\
It's not going to be alright

And I'd like to think that this will pass, this will pass \\
I know it's not the case \\
Of all the highs and lows and middle ends you brought me to \\
This is the worst place

## Memories ## {#memories}

Frankie Lane, he was singing Jezebel \\
I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel \\
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl \\
I said, "Look, you don't know me now \\
But very soon you will \\
So won't you let me see \\
Won't you let me see \\
Won't you let me see \\
Your naked body"

"Just dance me to the dark side of the gym \\
Chances are I'll let you do most anything" \\
She said "I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice \\
They're many parts of me to touch, you have your choice \\
But no you cannot see \\
No you cannot see \\
No you cannot see \\
My naked body"

We are dancing close, the band is playing Stardust \\
Balloons and paper streamers, they're floating down on us \\
She says, "You've got a minute left to fall in love" \\
In solemn moments such as this I've put my trust \\
And all my faith to see \\
I said all my faith to see \\
I said all my faith to see \\
Her naked body

## Going to Morocco ## {#morocco}

There's no wolves around here \\
There's no wolves around here \\
Have a drink \\
Drink your fill \\
From the tap \\
From the still \\
If you won't, I will \\
But there are no wolves around here

There's no reason to cry \\
There's no reason to cry \\
You can have a seat for a while \\
Relax \\
Smile \\
But don't touch that dial \\
'Cause there is no reason to cry

There's a guttural stop in my throat \\
There's a guttural stop in my throat \\
The wind comes in from far and wide \\
Sands blow \\
Grains collide \\
I'm changing inside \\
And there's a guttural stop in my throat

## Going to Michigan ## {#michigan}

As the car rolled north towards Michigan, you complained \\
That all I like to listen to is Gary Numan and the Tubeway Army \\
Well, maybe that's true - \\
But what about you \\
And the Blue Cheer comprehensive retrospective box set? \\
Thatâ€™s pretty annoying too

The wing window flew open \\
The air was thin \\
I heard you say so and I heard shadings of meaning therein
And your fingers touched mine \\
And that supersonic whine began \\
Near the back of my skull

And the white rose burned \\
You know exactly what I mean about the burning white rose \\
Yes, you do \\
Yes, you do

## Terminal Grain ## {#grain}

Well the train touched down in Sioux City, Iowa \\
The train touched down in Sioux City, Iowa \\
It fell cleanly from the dark sky under the track \\
Saw you from the window, there was no turning back

Well, the whistle went off, I was leaning up against the window \\
Yeah, the whistle went off, I was leaning up against the window \\
I saw the blue passengers walking past me \\
And you called up the calvary \\
It was so easy, and it was so hard \\
You were clutching your copy of Kierkegaard \\
Repetition, repetition

## Malevolent Seascape Y ## {#seascapey}

We saw the ship meet the horizon \\
We saw it carry him away \\
And the streamers on the hull were the last things to wink out of existence \\
As a cool breeze came in from across the bay \\
You dug around in the sand \\
You came up holding something \\
And when you handed it over with that smile on your face \\
I knew the three of us meant less than nothing

I held the seashell next to my ear, but I didn't hear anything \\
I held the seashell next to my ear, but I didn't hear anything

The dogfish swam beneath the jetty \\
Where our legs hung down \\
And the ocean hugged the sun with her long arms \\
As the lights came up above chinatown \\
I guess this makes it all easier \\
I guess it's smooth sailing now \\
I guess this irons out all the wrinkles from the fabric \\
I guess it never really mattered anyhow

I held the seashell next to my ear, but I didn't hear anything \\
I held the seashell next to my ear, but I didn't hear anything

## Going to Marrakesh ## {#marrakesh}

The fog is lifting from the water \\
The bells are sounding on the boats \\
And our love is a monster, plain and simple \\
Though you weigh it down with stones to try to drown it \\
It floats \\
It floats

The day of reckoning is coming \\
Faster than anyone here realizes \\
And our love is like Jesus but worse \\
Though you seal the cave up where you've lain its body \\
It rises \\
It rises

I keep waiting for our love to die \\
The machines by its bed \\
Dim and flicker but it won't stay dead \\
And it perks up when the nurses bring its medication by

I wish our love could go the way of all flesh \\
But it's not right and it's not nice \\
To try to kill the same thing twice \\
Would you pack your things? We are going to Marrakesh
