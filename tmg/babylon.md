## Ox Baker Triumphant [^oxjohn] [^oxdemo] [^oxseries] [^ox] ## {#ox}

I will rise from the swamp \\
Where they dumped my private plane \\
I'll be clutching the life preserver \\
In my teeth \\
And I will find the highway \\
And I will flag down a truck \\
Worry lines on my forehead \\
Blank stare underneath

And when I come back to town \\
I'm gonna cast my burden down \\
A little worse for wear \\
Practically walking on air 

I will thank my ride \\
And claw my way back inside \\
To the guts of the building where my enemies \\
Hide in the dark like roaches \\
And I will signal the camera crew \\
And everyone will do what he's been trained how to do \\
Sweat dripping from my face [^blood] \\
As my moment approaches

Click your heels, count to three [^oz] \\
I bet you never expected me \\
A little worse for wear \\
Practically walking on air

[^oxjohn]:
    The long story behind this song is told in a few places, an excellent
    version being at City Arts and Lectures, Herbst Theater, San Francisco,
    February 24, 2009:
    
    "It's not autobiographical, but it's based on a moment that I had that was
    a good moment with my stepfather where... so, I was a big wrestling fan,
    when I was in the fifth and sixth grade, I loved professional wrestling.
    And it was a small thing then, the WWF existed, but that was the East
    Coast syndicate, it was all divided up regionally, and it was a poor man's
    game. It cost $5 to get into the wrestling matches, and you'd see 12 of
    them, and it was --- poor people went to see them and enjoy them, and my
    family wasn't rich, and we would go to the wrestling matches because my
    stepfather's father had been a wrestling promoter in Indiana, and he would
    tell me about how stuff worked, but I didn't choose to believe a lot of it
    'cause I liked to believe in the good and the evil of my heroes and the
    villains...
    
    "This guy Ox Baker gets interviewed by Jeff Walton, the interviewer on
    Channel 56, I think, and Jeff says to Ox Baker, 'So what are you gonna
    show to the LA audience?' And Ox Baker says, "When I tell you that the
    blood is going to roll from Chavo Guerrero's eyes, and you'd better bring
    your handkerchiefs so you can dip it into the blood." And I knew it was
    supposed to sound evil, but it just didn't really make any sense. And I
    was like, I cocked my head and said, 'What is...', and my stepfather said,
    'Oh, how sad.' And I said, 'What?', and he said, 'Well, he's
    inarticulate.' ... But I liked Ox Baker because of his unintelligent evil,
    this evil that was too primal to really be chained by reason. So
    twenty-five years later I wrote this story about how, you know, all the
    wrestling stuff is real and they try and do away with Ox Baker and he
    comes to have his revenge on them."

    See also the excellent banter on the June 27, 2012 Swedish-American Hall,
    San Francisco show which gives more context, concluding, "This song is my
    dream of Ox Baker being forced to leave town and then coming back to his
    normal arena to seek revenge on those who would wrong him."

[^oxdemo]:
    The [demo](series.html#demos) for Ox Baker Triumphant was released on the
    [Seven for Australia](australia.html) online release. In his notes, John
    says, "demo for babylon springs ep lead-off. as I remember it took me all
    morning to get this one right." [What's Up You

[^blood]:
    Sometimes sung alternately as "Blood dripping down my face". See for
    example the February 24, 2009 Herbst Theater show in San Francisco, or the
    June 27, 2009 Swedish-American Hall show.

[^oz]:
    A reference to the ruby slippers in [The Wonderful Wizard of
    Oz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film)), a film
    adaptation of Frank L. Baum's children's novel. In the film, Dorothy, the
    young protagonist, can return home to Indiana anytime she wears the
    slippers by clicking them three times and saying, "There's no place like
    home". Sometimes this allusion is make more clear when John sings the line
    as "Click your ruby-slippered heels". See for example the June 27, 2009
    Swedish-American Hall show.
	
## Alibi [^alibijohn] [^alibidemo] [^alibiseries] ## {#alibi}

I got off work just past eleven \\
Laid one finger to the breeze \\
You can almost taste the action \\
On nights like these \\
Trees were bending in the wind \\
You were forty miles away \\
And I was headed in your direction \\
I've been waiting all day \\
I've been waiting all day

Moon over West Covina [^covina] was huge and white \\
And I was like a patient on a table \\
Headed for the light \\
Lean toward the center divider \\
Feel the wind in my hair \\
Keep a light up in your window \\
I'm gonna be right there \\
I'm gonna be right there

With a gleam in my eye \\
And an almost airtight alibi

Down by the chemistry building \\
I found a quiet place to park \\
And I made my way down the street toward your place \\
Stepping lightly in the dark \\
Climbed the steps up to your doorway \\
Like a man prepared to jump beneath a train \\
It's real warm outside tonight \\
Maybe tomorrow it rains \\
Maybe tomorrow it rains

Inside your room we shut the window \\
And we turned on a fan \\
And we lay there together in the darkness \\
I can keep a secret if you can \\
Finishing one another's sentences \\
Like a pair of identical twins \\
Your boyfriend's out of town until Tuesday \\
And nobody saw me come in \\
Nobody saw me come in

With a gleam in my eye \\
And an almost airtight alibi

[^alibijohn]:
    "This is a song about infidelity." Zoop, Farm Sanctuary, June 17, 2007

    "\[This\] is a song about how sometimes you may find yourself sleeping
    with somebody... and you may say to yourself about that situation, 'Boy,
    it's going to be horrible if her boyfriend ever finds out... 'cause he's
    probably gonna be mad when he finds out I'm sleeping with his girlfriend.
    That's --- boy, he'll be mad as hell. I'd prefer not to think about that
    now that I think about it, I'd think rather think about how nice she is.
    Ah, yeah, isn't she awesome? She deserves a good boyfriend like me,
    somebody awesome like me who really understands her and really appreciates
    what she's all about.' You might get to thinking that way. It's a
    delusional sort of thinking that can only result in terrible sadness. I
    don't mean to be the guy who breaks the news to you, yet must I be the guy
    breaking the news to you that it's not gonna --- it's gonna end very
    badly. And to the girl in the audience who is also part of that equation
    --- you know that's bogus." [Masonic Temple][2008-05-16], Brooklyn, New
    York, May 16, 2008.

## Sail Babylon Springs [^sailbabylonseries] [^babylon] ## {#sail}

And meanwhile downstairs \\
I'm setting up shop \\
A little too proud \\
To let the matter drop \\
And I can hear you up there \\
Isn't it romantic? \\
You're huffing and puffing rearranging \\
Deck chairs on the Titanic [^rearrange] \\
And I reach for a glass of cool water drawn \\
From the rivers of Babylon [^psalms137]

And meanwhile outside \\
The stars have come out \\
And the humid summer air \\
Pulls at the ring in my snout \\
And you stand at your window looking down \\
And I spread wide my arms \\
Jump if you want to jump \\
Jump if you want to \\
The water's warm

I know \\
I know 'cause I've been swimming \\
Blindly along through the rivers of Babylon

[^rearrange]:
    To "[rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic][rearrangewiki]" is an idiom

    liner infamous for sinking on its maiden voyage in 1912.

## Sometimes I Still Feel the Bruise [^bruiseseries] [^bluestars] ## {#bruise}

This is just to say hello \\
And to let you know \\
I think of you from time to time \\
I know I never really knew you \\
But somehow I miss you \\
And wish that you'd stayed in my life

Making contact gets harder \\
As the silence grows longer \\
And isn't it only me \\
Who'd like us to see each other \\
How I would hate to be a bother \\
The way we left it was you'd ring

I'm under no illusion \\
As to what I meant to you \\
But you made an impression \\
And sometimes I still feel the bruise \\
Sometimes I still feel the bruise

Now and then I'll stumble on \\
What I've misplaced but never lost \\
An ache I first felt long ago \\
Though you've appeared and disappeared \\
Throughout these past few years \\
I'd be surprised if you now showed

Making contact gets harder \\
As the silence grows longer \\
And why would you think of me \\
When you were not the one in love \\
When you were not the dreamer \\
When you were just the dream?

I'm under no illusion \\
As to what I meant to you \\
But you made an impression \\
And sometimes I still feel the bruise \\
Sometimes I still feel the bruise

## Wait For You [^waitdemo] [^waitseries] ## {#wait}

When it came time to wait for you \\
I took the bus to Malibu [^malibu] \\
Found a café by the ocean \\
Watched the sky for signs

And a rainbow in the west \\
Wrapped its coils around the earth like a serpent \\
I felt like I was going to suffocate

But I knew this was not the day \\
You would finally come my way \\
But I waited all the same \\
Watched the water through the window

And a rainbow in the west \\
Held its head beneath the waves and grew dimmer \\
Nothing anyone could do I suppose

[^waitdemo]:
    Like Ox Baker Triumphant and Alibi, a [demo](series.html#demos) for Wait
    for You was released on the [Seven for Australia](australia.html) online

    springs. almost called that ep 'wait for you' because I am fond of this
