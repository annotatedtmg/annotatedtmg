[^dativejohn]:
    From the Ghana liner notes:

    > Vain Priestly, a gore/grindmetal "singer" from near Ukiah, was convinced
    > that the whole indie scene was going to break wide open and that cassettes
    > would shortly displace compact discs in the marketplace. Grabbing
    > opportunity by the horns, he set up a production-and-distribution center
    > out in the woods and invited us up to see it. When we arrived, we were
    > forced at knifepoint to write and record these six songs. I think this
    > extra incentive is what lends "Going to Jamaica" its desperate edge.
    > Thanks, Vain! You are a true patron of the arts.

    I've been unable to find any information about Priestly. If you know
    something, please [drop me a line](../about.html#contact).

    Taking the Dative, like [Transmissions to Horace](horace.html#extras)
    before it, has some copies with extra songs on them, supposedly. This
    would include the otherwise unheard-of song "8 to 20 on a Weapons Charge".

[^dative]:
    The [dative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dative_case) is a grammatical
    case used to denote the indirect (and in some languages, the direct)
    object of a verb. While not found in English, it is found in Latin, which
    is presumably where John learned about it.

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

*(writing):*

We ran away from the nine month ice blast of Portland to Las Vegas, eyes
bloodshot, our bodies coming alive with fear. We checked into a ground floor
room at the Stardust [^stardust] and went to sleep for two days. Three years
later you got pregnant and the tickets to Florida were cheap, cheap. It was
either Florida or back to California, and that was just out of the question.
[^alpha]

We are John, Rachel, Sara, Rosanne and Amy. Thank you Joel for just plain
everything. Sequenced by Peter Hughes himself. OK.

*(typed text):*

Long-tailed Weasel *Mustela frenata* [^weasel]

Like the related skunks, Mink, and Badger, weasels have five toes. But in
weasels the fifth toe is small, so that tracks usually show just four toes.
All weasels are quick and agile, with long, slim bodies that enable them to
enter narrow crevices and burrows in pursuit of small mammals, reptiles, and
frogs; they also prey on birds. In turn, they are captured by hawks, owls,
foxes, and large snakes.

[^stardust]:
    The [Stardust Resort and
    Casino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_Resort_and_Casino) was a
    famous casino located on the Las Vegas strip until 2007.

[^alpha]:
    Given the consistency with the [Alpha couple](series.html#alpha), I assume
    this describes them. However, this story is inconsistent with the
    established narrative in three ways: living in Portland, pregnancy, and
    flying or taking some other sort of transit to Florida rather than driving
    along the bottom of the country. I'm not sure if these are reliable
    additions or parts of the story that were later removed from the
    narrative.

[^weasel]:
    The [long-tailed
    weasel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-tailed_weasel), or *Mustela
    frenata*, is as described. They live widely throughout North and Central
    America.

## Orange Ball of Peace [^johnpeace] [^peaceseries] ## {#peace}

They wanted me to be a lawyer \\
They wanted me to work in a machine shop [^cop] \\
They wanted me to be a designer \\
But I came out on top

I'm a fireman \\
I'm a fireman

Stand and watch the smoke \\
See the flames rise to the sky \\
I stand and watch the flames climb higher \\
I feel the smoke get in my eyes

I'm a fireman \\
I'm a fireman [^yep]

## Standard Bitter Love Song \#8 [^sbls8series] ## {#sbls8}

I went down to Lloyd Center [^lloyd] \\
Looking for you \\
But a mouth full of anger \\
Blocked my view \\
He took your hand \\
There in the skating ring \\
God will give him blood to drink

Saw the two of you leaving \\
I didn't want to follow behind \\
But I could see the rest of your evening \\
Burning in my mind \\
Sky's black \\
The moon's pink \\
God will give him blood to drink

I looked over the railing \\
Ice was white \\
On the northeast side where I saw you and your boyfriend \\
On a Friday night \\
I went mining for gold \\
I struck pure, fresh zinc \\
God, God will give him blood to drink \\
Hey hey hey

## Chino Love Song 1979 [^chinoseries] [^chino] ## {#chino1979}

*"... family, and, uh, cleave to your wife --- and, and that, that, I think
that really set the theme for us, as far as the oneness. And that was the, the
oneness and the completeness."* [^chinoopening]

And the May sun shone down on California \\
And the strawberries grew fat and full \\
And thick and red and as big as your fist \\
And the traffic on Riverside Drive [^riverside] was thin \\
But by no means nonexistent \\
When I saw you \\
Against the soda machine \\
I saw you leaning there

And your hand in the basket \\
Was nimble-fingered and red-fingernailed \\
And it made me remember the sunflower \\
That popped up outside my window one morning in Norwalk [^norwalk] \\
It was bright yellow and it was real inviting \\
And I almost forgot that it was an intruder \\
And I saw you \\
Against the soda machine \\
I saw you leaning there

I saw you \\
Against the soda machine \\
I saw you leaning there

[^chino]:
    [Chino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chino,_California) is an Inland

    father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be
    one flesh."

## Going to Jamaica [^jamaicajohn] [^jamaicaseries] [^jamaica] ## {#jamaica}

We saw the last of the brightly-colored birds \\
Check out and make for the other world \\
And you asked me how much longer we'd have to stay here \\
But I'm not at liberty to say \\
And what flowers there were around Kingston [^kingston] \\
Were blue

I ripped them up from the dry soil \\
And draped them over you

We saw the last of the bright birds coming home \\
I saw you address them through your megaphone \\
And you asked me when we were leaving \\
Well, it's any day now \\
And what flowers there were around Trenchtown [^trenchtown] \\
Were red

I stole them from the hands of children \\
Braided them around your head

[^jamaicajohn]:
    "So, like a lot of my songs, this one is about anticipatory loss. Right?
    It's like, it's about bracing yourself, right. You get this feeling after
    you have a little practice that the best thing to do is to develop a good
    stance against incoming heavy forces. OK? That way, when it comes... then
    maybe you won't get knocked entirely down, right. Then maybe you can at
    least stand there and challenge it, and come at you again. It doesn't
    really work at all, because the force continues to redouble its efforts,
    because it has all time, and you don't have that long. This is a song
    about not having that long." --- Bottom of the Hill, San Francisco, June
    13, 2014

    "This is another one of those songs where you got two people, they were
    once deeply in love, and then it's like a monster came, a terrible
    monster. But it wasn't really a monster, it was poor communication skills.
    But because in all likelihood they have or have had in the past some
    difficulties with alcohol, it seems more like it must have been a monster,
    because how could poor communication skills have made such an awful mess?"
    --- Go Rehearsal Studios, Room 4, Carrboro, October 15, 2000

    With descriptions like those above, and the similarity between this and
    [Have to Explode](tallahassee.html#explode), people occasionally argue
    that Going to Jamaica is an [Alpha couple](series.html#alpha) song. While
    there are songs that are unrelated to Tallahassee and lack Alpha in the
    title yet are still in the series, many songs about divorce and alcoholism
    exist in the Mountain Goats canon and yet are not Alpha songs. I have yet
    to hear anything where John states that this belongs in the Alpha couple
    series and so at this point I am of the opinion that it stands outside of
    it.

## Alpha Gelida [^gelidajohn] [^gelidaseries] [^gelida] ## {#gelida}

Popcorn was snapping in the hot oil on the kitchen stove \\
And the sky through the kitchen window was cold and poised and threatening \\
Heard your voice come lilting [^ringing] through the wall \\
I heard your voice come sailing from the other room \\
Let the young lions come \\
Let me break their jaws [^psalms586] \\
Let the young lions come out \\
Let me break their jaws \\
With my bare fingers

Coffee was dripping through the paper filter cone \\
The heady [^hip] scent of it nearly knocked me out \\
I heard your voice come lilting through the back of the refrigerator \\
Heard your voice come breaking through the wall \\
Let the young lions come out \\
Let me talk them out of it \\
Let the young lions come \\
Let me break their jaws \\
With my bare fingers

    This song takes place in Nevada while the Alpha couple is living on
    Flamingo Drive, just off the strip, similar to what is described in the
    [liner notes](dative.html#liner). Bottom of the Hill, San Francisco, June
    13, 2014

    "It's a song about a refrigerator, essentially." --- Cobblestone, Dublin,
    October 9, 2002

    "... I don't quite get what's going on in the song. I mean, most of the
    time I have a pretty good idea of what's going on with the people, and I
    don't really know what is behind the refrigerator in this song. I hope
    someday to find out." --- Swedish-American Hall, San Francisco, June 28,
    2012. See also McCabe's Guitar Shop, Santa Monica, June 30, 2012.

    "I'm pretty sure that both the people in it are crazy, and I know --- I
    have people that I talk to about, like, trying to, like, eliminate the
    word crazy as a dismissive, and I get that, right, and I understand that,
    but then you think about, well, but no, these people, can we at least call
    them crazy? Can we agree that they seem to set everything they love on
    fire, and that's, like, totally not a good working strategy?" --- McCabe's
    Guitar Shop, Santa Monica, June 30, 2012

    "This is a --- well, I don't really know what to say about this song,
    really. The people in it seem to be having a hard time of it. I hope it
    they feel better soon... Bet they won't." --- Swedish-American Hall, San
    Francisco, June 27, 2012

[^gelida]:
    *Gelida* is a conjugated version of the Latin word *gelidus*, meaning icy
    or ice-cold.

[^ringing]:
    Other adjectives are sometimes used in these lines, for example,
    "ringing", "tearing", "drifting", "breaking", "keening", and "roaring".

[^psalms586]:
    A reference to [Psalms
    58:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+58%3A6&version=HCSB),
    which, in describing how God will wreak vengeance upon the wicked,
    exhorts:

    > God, knock the teeth out of their mouths; \\
    > Lord, tear out the young lions' fangs.

    Holman Christian Standard Bible, retrieved August 10, 2014.

[^hip]:
    Nall transcribes this word as "hip", but it's clearly two syllables both
    here and in live versions. The clearest live show recording for this
    phrase in my opinion are the Zoop or Broadway Kino shows [listed
    above](#fn:ringing).
