## Garbage Eaters [^eatersjohn] ## {#eaters}

I recognize your dirty face \\
I know you're from uptown \\
Hold your head high \\
Hold your head high

We're going to colonize this place \\
And stop the sun from going down \\
By and by all right \\
By and by

Keep your countenance as bright as can be \\
And hold the dumpster open for me \\
Me

The water level's going down \\
The table's never going to rise \\
We will be all right \\
We will be all right

Come in alone, go out alone \\
Feel lonesome in between \\
Keep your hands wet \\
In the red clay

Let your light be a beacon \\
To cruel and heartless men \\
Learn from your mistakes \\
Then make the same mistakes again \\
Hey

    Written for a friend's wedding. "As most wedding songs are called
    eventually, it's called Garbage Eaters. It's a love song." --- Cat's
    Cradle, Carrboro, July 17, 2004.

## Going through Pomona ## {#pomona}

The lights are on in your room, so tell me \\
Who's your friend? \\
And the lights are burning in the \\
Little house on East End

And I remembered who I was \\
And what I came here for \\
The moon was caught \\
High in the branches of the sycamore

And on my neck \\
I felt the cold wind \\
And it licked around my ears and it asked me to ask you \\
Yeah --- who's your friend?

And the lights came down over Pomona \\
Blazed again before your front door \\
The moon was caught \\
High in the branches of the sycamore

## Going to Brazil ## {#brazil}

*"For the record, this is the fifth attempt at get --- Going to Brazil."*

You've got something magic in your eyes \\
You don't have to say you're sorry \\
You've got a sentence waiting on your tongue \\
Pronounce it now

I'm going where the air is hot \\
Where they speak a language sort of like one I can speak \\
I'm going to South America \\
Don't wait up for me

You've got what I need but I can't have it \\
That's all right \\
You're everything I want and I can't touch you \\
Let me touch you anyhow

I'm going where the air is hot \\
Where they speak a language sort of like one I can speak \\
Yeah, I am going to South America \\
Don't wait up for me

I've got what you want but that's enough of that \\
That'll be enough of that for now \\
It's gonna clear cut twenty thousand acres \\
When I touch your hair

I'm going where the air is hot \\
Where they speak a language sort of like one I can speak \\
Yeah, I am going to South America \\
Don't wait up for me

I'm going where the air is hot \\
Where they speak a language sort of like one I can speak \\
Yeah I am going to South America \\
Don't wait up for me

## Going to Bridlington [^bridlingtonjohn] [^bridlingtonseries] [^bridlington] ## {#bridlington}

Stopped by for the coffee and cake that you promised \\
Saw your porch light on \\
Saw your wire-haired terrier [^terrier] \\
Lazing on the lawn \\
Came right in through the front door \\
Went right down the main hall \\
Turned right into the kitchen \\
There you were, all right

The moon was rising over Bridlington \\
And you had blood all over your hands \\
Someone was singing in the yard next door \\
And you had blood all over your hands

Sat down on the kitchen floor \\
Looked up at you \\
Saw you smoothing down your skirt around your thighs \\
Wondered what good that was supposed to do \\
And I saw you pull your hair back \\
Saw you messing with your earrings [^towardme] \\
Saw you trying to smile \\
Hey, you don't have to smile for me

The moon was rising over Bridlington \\
And you had blood all over your hands \\
Something was cracking in the rafters of our house [^floorboards] \\
And you had blood all over your hands \\
The moon was rising over Bridlington \\
The moon was rising over Bridlington \\
The moon was rising

    John has said multiple times that he doesn't like this song: 

    "I have no love for this song because I think it blows esp. the lyrics are
    plenty lame but am happy if people are getting pleasure from it."

    Mountain Goats forums, [Going to
    Bridlington](http://www.mountain-goats.com/forums/read.php?2,37630,37759#msg-37759),

    "Now, you know, I'll tell you the truth, it's that I don't like that song,
    but I'll play it, if you want to hear it. ... I mean, I'm gonna play this
    song, that I don't like, but --- I get into it anyway. \<plays song\>

    "I mean, let me tell you why I don't like it. It's like, it seems like a
    decent enough idea, but when I hear the chorus, it just sounds like the
    laziest little placeholder of all time. It just sounds like, 'Yeah, I
    know, John had an idea, but he was so anxious to get the second verse of
    it --- yeah, we'll put some blood on the hands in the chorus and we'll
    come back and fix it later'. But then, I was on a radio show that day, and
    so I went and played it. Well, then, once you play it on a radio show,
    then it's set in stone and you must play it the same forever, otherwise
    you suffer in Hell for eternity, and --- this is an obscure provision of
    the Bible that you guys don't know about, but I'm here to tell you about
    it --- radio shows and playing songs the same way. So yeah, so that's what
    happened with that one. One of these days I'll fix it, maybe, after I
    retire. It'll be my hobby --- you know, some people woodwork? I'll iron
    out the choruses of songs that were denied the good choruses they
    deserved." --- Attucks Theatre, Norfolk, March 20, 2009

## Going to Buffalo ## {#buffalo}

Lay down just a little while \\
Honey lemon chamomile \\
Very soon the plane's coming in

One hour worth of quicksand \\
The glass warm against your hand \\
Very soon the airplane will take me away

I will nuzzle up against you and then \\
I will never see you again

Fires burning  \\
The world's turning \\
Around

Words that lose their meanings \\
And then swell up like balloons \\
Very soon the taxi will come

All the lies you told me \\
Can no longer hold me \\
Very soon the taxi will take me away

I will forget how you've done me wrong \\
How you've strung me along

Fires burning \\
Burning \\
To breathe

## Going to Dade County ## {#dade}

When the rainbows disappeared from the skies of northern Florida \\
'Cause the rain had gone away \\
And I looked out on the front lawn and I saw you there \\
It was 6:31 AM on a Saturday

And you turned into a housecat \\
And you all think I'm making this part up \\
But you're wrong

And the wind came through the window \\
And licked at my face \\
And I heard the sound of about a thousand housecats [^tomcats] \\
Squalling up from all over the place

And you all think I'm crazy \\
Or trying to make up some kind of a cheap story \\
Or telling little stories to amuse myself with \\
But you're wrong

I am going to Dade County \\
Right now

[^tomcats]:
    Also sung, "... a thousand tomcats". Under Acme, New York, August 18,
    1994.

## Going to France ## {#france}

You say \\
It's too cold over there anyway \\
It's far too cold

I'm going to France \\
And I'm taking you with me

Wild berries \\
Wild sheep \\
You know you want to see them

Well I'm going to France \\
And I'm taking you with me

We always said one day we were going there \\
Well I don't know about you \\
But I keep my promises

And I'm going to France \\
And I'm taking you with me

## Going to Palestine ## {#palestine}

That woman set herself on fire \\
They said it on the radio \\
They said she lit up the skies of Palestine \\
I could not stand to hear them say so

I saw the stars come out \\
Smelled the oranges on the breeze \\
Later on they played some Caribbean song \\
Man they sure know how to pick 'em

The rich voice burning like a fuse \\
The syncopated rhythms \\
I saw the stars come out \\
I saw the oranges cracking open

I saw you standing there \\
Orange blossom in your hair \\
Going to Palestine \\
Going to Palestine \\
Yeah

## Going to San Diego ## {#sandiego}

Long rain \\
It must be June again \\
Warm air \\
And it's so warm down there

I'm coming soon, open the blinds \\
Your friends all tell me that you've lost your mind \\
I don't believe them

The seashore \\
I don't want to see it anymore \\
The bus runs smoothly \\
The back window's open and the burning air cools me

Hold your breath \\
Your friends all swear you're one step away from death \\
I don't believe them

Mmm, here it comes \\
My head is throbbing and my hands are numb \\
It's you \\
What was I thinking, what should I do

Your eyes are open, it's more than I can take \\
My friends all told me I was making a mistake \\
I don't believe them

## Going to Some Damned English City ## {#damnedcity}

Your skirt was red and flowing, your blouse was blue \\
On the night I locked eyes with you \\
It seemed to me like I hadn't seen your eyes since last December

My shredding muscles, my popping joints \\
I saw the pupils of your eyes by the firelight shrinking down to pinpoints \\
You were poking at the embers

There's a cold wind coming off the ocean \\
There's a cold wind coming off the ocean

I wet my finger with my tongue and pressed it in the ashes \\
Rubbed it up against your perfect eyelashes \\
You said something really important, something pretty seems to have slipped my mind

Walls were freezing, so was the floor \\
I didn't want to hurt you anymore \\
You had a sad, sad friend in front of you, that dying fire behind

There was a cold wind coming off the ocean \\
There was a cold wind coming off the ocean

## Going to Spirit Lake ## {#spiritlake}

Why did you say what you said \\
When the hummingbird vanished from sight \\
In the sudden swelling heat \\
Of the dark October night

You were laughing and your eyes were alive \\
And I knew that the moment had finally arrived \\
And I reached out through the air for your hand \\
And held on tight

You said the right thing \\
You fixed everything \\
As the stars formed a canopy \\
Over Spirit Lake

You said what you said \\
The stars grew softer overhead \\
I was on fire \\
I was on fire for you

## I've Got the Sex [^gotsexjohn] [^gotsexsweden] [^gotsexseries] ## {#gotsex}

Crushing strawberries one by one \\
Watching the juice drip down \\
Four and a half [^twoandahalf] months ahead of schedule \\
The leaves on the trees were turning brown \\
We got ready for winter as the sun rose up in the sky \\
There was something almost soothing in the hard to define \\
Note of terror in your eye

Watching the strawberries lose their shapes \\
As the wind blew through the elm tree \\
The wind was far too cold for the middle of April \\
And you reached out your hand to me \\
It was good to have your hand in mine \\
It was good to know you felt the chill too \\
I scooped up a palmful of strawberry pulp \\
And smeared it all over you

The wild strawberries drove me on \\
As I lapped them up off of your skin \\
And I could feel your basal body temperature rise as the cold came in \\
Hey hey

    "It's about that moment at which you pass from thinking that maybe it's
    all right to trust somebody that you were pretty sure was gonna do wrong
    by you, but you think you've gotten past all that... to knowing that
    they'll to kill you for sure. And getting excited about that. You know,
    feeling the love in that. --- CBGBs, New York, New York, July 23, 1999

    "So there you are, in your room, and you're not by yourself though you
    feel as though you are. And the same thing is going on in your intended's
    mind, but nobody's saying anything about it, because a lot of people,
    including the people in this song, think, you know, 'If I just don't say
    anything, then magic will happen and everything will change.' Nothing will
    change. The only thing that's gonna happen is that they're going to fall
    back into a old behavior pattern. And for somewhere between 20 minutes and
    3 hours, depending on how much they've had to drink, it's going to feel
    really, really intense. But then afterwards it's a bad situation. ---
    Will's Pub, Orlando, Florida, April 9, 2003

    "This is a song about a moment that all of you are gonna come to sooner or
    later and I want you to think of me and curse my name when you do." ---
    University of Wisconsin--Madison, June 12, 1997

[^gotsexsweden]:
	"This was supposed to be the first song on Sweden, but when I got to
    the John Golden mastering place it turned out that the song --- the tape
    that this song was on --- I had left it at home. So you might say, 'Oh,
    we'll add that in later'. That was not the Mountain Goats style in 1995.
    Our style was, you show up and you use the tools you brought with you. So
    we made the second song \[The Recognition Scene\] the first song, and this
    one was sent down to perdition and the ignominy of just being played
    live." --- Swedish-American Music Hall, San Francisco, February 28, 2016

    I've Got the Sex is part of the informal [series of

[^twoandahalf]:
    Also sung "two and half". See for example University of
    Wisconsin--Madison, June 12, 1997.

## If England Were What England Seems, Then We Would Only Have Our Dreams [^englanddreamsjohn] ## {#englanddreams}

I told you I was never coming back \\
I was trying to breathe evenly \\
When the phone stopped ringing for the first time in a long time \\
And you flashed that smile at me \\
And then you opened up the window \\
I felt the air roll in \\
In the place where the world stops forever \\
In the place where your body begins

You were staring down at the street below \\
There was nobody there \\
They'd built a fire down there in the alley \\
I saw the fires rising everywhere \\
And then you opened up the window \\
The north wind began to blow \\
We were just a few short hours from something really special \\
And I heard you singing soft and low

Hey
