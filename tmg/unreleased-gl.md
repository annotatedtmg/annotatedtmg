## I've Got the Sex [^gotsexjohn] [^gotsexsweden] [^gotsexseries] ## {#gotsex}

Crushing strawberries one by one \\
Watching the juice drip down \\
Four and a half [^twoandahalf] months ahead of schedule \\
The leaves on the trees were turning brown \\
We got ready for winter as the sun rose up in the sky \\
There was something almost soothing in the hard to define \\
Note of terror in your eye

Watching the strawberries lose their shapes \\
As the wind blew through the elm tree \\
The wind was far too cold for the middle of April \\
And you reached out your hand to me \\
It was good to have your hand in mine \\
It was good to know you felt the chill too \\
I scooped up a palmful of strawberry pulp \\
And smeared it all over you

The wild strawberries drove me on \\
As I lapped them up off of your skin \\
And I could feel your basal body temperature rise as the cold came in \\
Hey hey

    "It's about that moment at which you pass from thinking that maybe it's
    all right to trust somebody that you were pretty sure was gonna do wrong
    by you, but you think you've gotten past all that... to knowing that
    they'll to kill you for sure. And getting excited about that. You know,
    feeling the love in that. --- CBGBs, New York, New York, July 23, 1999

    "So there you are, in your room, and you're not by yourself though you
    feel as though you are. And the same thing is going on in your intended's
    mind, but nobody's saying anything about it, because a lot of people,
    including the people in this song, think, you know, 'If I just don't say
    anything, then magic will happen and everything will change.' Nothing will
    change. The only thing that's gonna happen is that they're going to fall
    back into a old behavior pattern. And for somewhere between 20 minutes and
    3 hours, depending on how much they've had to drink, it's going to feel
    really, really intense. But then afterwards it's a bad situation. ---
    Will's Pub, Orlando, Florida, April 9, 2003

    "This is a song about a moment that all of you are gonna come to sooner or
    later and I want you to think of me and curse my name when you do." ---
    University of Wisconsin--Madison, June 12, 1997

[^gotsexsweden]:
	"This was supposed to be the first song on Sweden, but when I got to
    the John Golden mastering place it turned out that the song --- the tape
    that this song was on --- I had left it at home. So you might say, 'Oh,
    we'll add that in later'. That was not the Mountain Goats style in 1995.
    Our style was, you show up and you use the tools you brought with you. So
    we made the second song \[The Recognition Scene\] the first song, and this
    one was sent down to perdition and the ignominy of just being played
    live." --- Swedish-American Music Hall, San Francisco, February 28, 2016

[^gotsexseries]:
    I've Got the Sex is part of the informal [series of
    outtakes](series.html#outtakes).

[^twoandahalf]:
    Also sung "two and half". See for example University of
    Wisconsin--Madison, June 12, 1997.

## If England Were What England Seems, Then We Would Only Have Our Dreams [^englanddreamsjohn] ## {#englanddreams}

I told you I was never coming back \\
I was trying to breathe evenly \\
When the phone stopped ringing for the first time in a long time \\
And you flashed that smile at me \\
And then you opened up the window \\
I felt the air roll in \\
In the place where the world stops forever \\
In the place where your body begins

You were staring down at the street below \\
There was nobody there \\
They'd built a fire down there in the alley \\
I saw the fires rising everywhere \\
And then you opened up the window \\
The north wind began to blow \\
We were just a few short hours from something really special \\
And I heard you singing soft and low

Hey

    "This is part of a new series of songs --- tonight is its world debut!
    They are songs that Graeme Jefferies and I are working on. This one's just
    by me, though. I expect at some later date Graeme will do something with
    it." --- WNUR session, January 18, 1996

    "It's part of an eight-song cycle that never made it past the planning
    stages." --- WNUR session, March 8, 2002

    I'm not aware of other songs written collaboratively with Graeme, but if
    you are, please [reach out](../about.html#contact)!

    [Graeme Jefferies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Jefferies) is a
    Kiwi musician who toured with John in the early days of the Mountain
    Goats. He played in The Cakekitchen, Nocturnal Projections, and This Kind
    of Punishment.
