    Originally titled
    [Jab-Jab](http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Research/SubjectGuide/Carnival/tabid/105/Default.aspx?PageContentID=81),
    a Caribbean term for a person costumed as Satan for Carnival, The
    Coroner's Gambit is thematically oriented around death. "This record took
    so long to write, you know -- it went through so many different themes and
    had so many songs -- but there was one song from early on, when the album
    was still called Jab-Jab, that pushed it toward being a record about death
    and terminal places. The song didn't end up on the album. It was called
    'Tampa.' If you can get a tape of the set I did at Terrastock in San
    Francisco, I think I opened with it there. It was a terribly dark song
    about someone who finds a body buried in the snow, and when I noticed that
    both it and 'Family Happiness' were probably going to be on the same
    record, I thought: 'Why not point the whole album toward the grave?' Then
    I looked at some other songs from the preceding months and saw how they'd
    fit into that theme, and it sort of grew from there, and new things came
    in and pushed out the old ones."  --- [Heavy Metal, Ephemera, and Popular
    Culture: A Chat with the Mountain
    Goats](http://www.spacecityrock.com/issue4/mountaingoats1.html), Space
    City Rock, Spring 2001

    John mentions this as being the first album he believes he started writing
    strong material for: "To me the songs start to get interesting around *The
    Coroner's Gambit*, that's sort of the dividing line for me..." --- William
    Caxton Fan Club, [Which albums are you playing songs from on your current
    tour?](http://johndarnielle.tumblr.com/post/51974994012/which-albums-are-you-playing-songs-from-on-your-current)

    The Coroner's Gambit was originally intended to be released in two parts;
    a vinyl produced version with arrangements and a CD version with boombox
    recordings. This ultimately didn't come to pass, resulting in the
    Coroner's Gambit we have now, with a mix of home versions and more
    polished takes. "The idea here is to say something about the malleability
    of even the most volatile material... The honest truth is that I'd like
    for people to pick one format (based, probably, on which cover art appeals
    to them more) and then commit to that one. They can have someone tape them
    a copy of the other format, if they want to have both, doesn't bother me a
    bit. I do hope there'll be a few people who'll buy one and say to
    themselves, 'This one is good enough for me; I don't want or need to hear
    the other one.'" --- Cory Brown interview, circa 1999

He was an old Hmong [^hmong] craftsman who worked mainly in wood ---
altarpieces like small bowls for water or petals, elephant-shaped incense
burners, intricate rosebuds or lotuses, and, later, in accord with the
inevitable crushing forward movement of the age, crucifixes ---and lived in a
house his father had built in the nineteen-twenties. His father had done
whatever work he'd been able to pick up in order to feed the family; selling
hand-carved trinkets at religious festivals was what had done the job during
the long Thai holiday season, and that was where he'd picked it up. His
woodwork was neither a hobby nor a form of meditation for him, and he didn't
think of himself or his job as anachronistic in any way. It was what he did
for a living during the daylight hours.

He fell in love with a woman who had initially stopped by the table he set up
on Friday mornings on Ratchwithi Road [^ratchawithi] near the children's
school. She was from Taiwan: she'd met a Thai businessman there when she was
nineteen, and he had brought her back home with him. Together they'd raised
two daughters and a son, and then, in her forty-eighth year, just as she'd
begun to enjoy adjusting to her new role as one-half of a doting grandparental
couple (her first daughter, Mae Noi, having given her a grandson), her husband
had been struck by a motorcycle weaving in and out of traffic during the
permanent rush-hour conditions that plague the downtown Bangkok streets. The
accident was not serious for the rider, who landed atop the car against which
his motorcycle had pinned his victim, but the victim had suffered internal
injuries too grave to be repaired. He died after two days in the hospital. She
mourned him for as long as she could, and then, on days when she felt
perfectly fine and the world seemed pleasant and good, she found herself
mourning him some more.

Her sister-in-law came to live with her; the feeling between them was really
more a matter of duty than of affection, but she was genuinely appreciative of
the company. Though Mae Noi and the baby came by once a week for tea, it was
hard to be alone; even with her sister-in-law there to share memories of the
husband and brother they'd lost, and to make small talk when the memories
became painful, she felt acutely and terribly lonely many times throughout the
day. So when she stopped at his table of hand-carved bodshisattvas
[^bodhisattva] and spirit-houses [^spirithouse] by the school one Friday while
walking her grandson to class, and he asked her innocently whether it wasn't a
lovely Spring morning, she felt sharp pangs of excitement and gratitude. The
feelings were like young sprouts pushing through cool earth in their
difficult, explosive journey through the soil to the surface. Of course he had
been lonely forever; his father and mother, though good people, had given him
little idea of how one wound up getting married, and so he had wound up never
doing so. Though a solitary person by nature, he was still a very friendly man
to anyone who got to know him, and he loved company though he lacked the
ability to say so. She found him charming, and after seeing her at his stall a
number of times throughout the course of the school year he invited her to his
small, old house for soup, where they told each other stories of their lives
--- small stories, without the huge dramatic flourishes with which more
fortunate people feel the need to embellish their histories. His soup was mild
and nutty like the food that the people in the hills had been enjoying for
thousands of years. It made her feel loved, and she loved him for it. They
spent many evenings giving sustenance to one another, and teaching each other
songs they'd sung as children. He told her how to say "good grandson" in the
Hmong language, and she transliterated his name into Mandarin so he could sign
his name to his pieces in one elegant, small character.

The time was not very long for them; he was fifteen years older than she was,
maybe more, and while decades of daily exercise had kept his body in trim
fighting shape, he could feel in his blood that he had the same hard arteries
that had killed both his father and his grandfather while they were still
relatively young. Within a few years of their unfathomable fortune in finding
one another they were both gone, the second following the first in natural
response to unendurable grief and loss. Their time together was sweet and
warm, and was like nothing else in the world. May their names, which history
has seen fit to hide in the warm folds of its endless memory, be sung forever
in the wordless movement of young trees in the wind. Let the love they
cultivated like delicate juniper seedlings go on growing forever, rooted in
its own self-sustaining riches. May the hours they gave one another wash
gently over our cold world and heal its terrible sickness. May they rest in
the limitless grace and peace that is their love's one true reward. [^vinyl]

Elijah, Baboon, Horseradish Road, Onions, and the Alphonse Mambo recorded in
Omaha with Simon Joyner, Chris Deden, Lonnie Methe, Brad Smith, John Kotchen,
Steve Micek, and Pat Oakes. All of them are owed money and are to be treated
with deference and respect. Five of the remaining songs were recorded at Main
St. in Colo, which is a small town in Iowa, and the rest were recorded two
blocks north of Emma McCarthy Lee Park in Ames, which is a considerably larger
town half an hour west of Colo. Though happy circumstances currently have the
Mountain Goats claiming Ames, we continue to straight up represent Colo and
will put the slap down on anyone who disrespects it. Transfer and levels by
Bob Durkee at fBE in Pomona, California, with Joel Huschle attending. As a
result of some regrettable but inevitable conversations that took place during
the transfer, Bob, Joel, and the Mountain Goats have formed a new,
super-powerful punk rock machine called Stage Bidet [^stagebidet], and we urge
you to watch for us and clear us a wide berth whenever we're in your town.
Instead of thanking all the people I always thank to whom I say, collectively
and with no less sincerity: thanks, I am just going to spend the time left us
here addressing an absent friend. Rozz:[^rozz] I wish you hadn't've gone and
killed yourself. Though I hadn't seen or spoken with you in eight years since
that night when, as far as I can tell from the reports I was later able to
piece together, you tried, not without reason, to strangle the life out of me
out there on the landing of Damien's apartment and I probably never would have
ever seen you again anyway, it was still hard to hear that you were gone. All
your friends had been predicting your death since the early eighties, and
no-one could bear the though of you growing old, but none of that did anything
to soften the blow when I heard. I don't really believe that the dead see or
hear what we do out here in the realm of corruptible things,[^1peter118] and I
don't imagine that anyone reads the scribblings on the backs of album jackets
to them, either, so I am really only addressing a memory. To that memory I
say: I thought of you now and then when I was writing these songs. I don't
suppose they'd do much for you, but I thought of you all the same. All your
friends miss you in some way, a little or a lot. The rumors about your final
hours are dismal and tawdry: I am sure they would please you immensely. For
your sake, I hope that the Christians were wrong and that you were right about
whether the faithless are destined for eternal torment. In the event that you
are a ghost and are wandering the earth moaning and rattling chains, I moved
to Iowa from California four or five years ago: stop by any time. Have a seat
on the couch until I get home from work. Help yourself to anything in the
refrigerator, or to the whiskey and sake on top of it. Make yourself right at
home.

[^vinyl]:
    This text is only present on the vinyl version of the Coroner's Gambit. "I
    put it on the vinyl since I figured that people who favor the CD format
    are probably more inclined to care mainly about the sound that's on the
    medium, whereas vinyl-favoring people tend to be more into the
    whole-package aspect of things -- details, you know. Ephemera." --- [Heavy

[^linerseries]:
    The liner notes to the Coroner's Gambit are part of the [informal series
    of Biblical references](series.html#bible).

[^stagebidet]:
    A [bidet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidet) is a washbasin for the
    genitalia. The only reference to a stage bidet I could find was in Dan
    Rhodes' book, This is Life, p. 42: "He sat on the on-stage bidet to check
    it for comfort, then lay for a while on the single bed, after which he
    requested a firmer mattress." John answers a question about Stage Bidet in
    a [2001 interview with Space City
    Rock](http://www.spacecityrock.com/issue4/mountaingoats1.html) as follows:

    SCR: The liner notes to The Coroner's Gambit reference Stage Bidet. How
    and when should we expect Stage Bidet to manifest itself publicly, if at
    all?

    JD: Run screaming if you ever hear that Stage Bidet is playing your town.
    Stage Bidet, when it comes, will not be pretty. That is all I care to say
    about it this early in the morning. I don't even want to think about it.

[^rozz]:
    [Rozz Williams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozz_Williams) was an Inland
    Empire musician alongside John. He fronted the goth rock band Christian
    Death until committing suicide on April 1, 1998. Several Mountain Goats
    songs, namely [Shadow Song](#shadow), ["Bluejays and
    Cardinals"](#bluejays), [Maybe Sprout Wings](lonely.html#fn:likeyou), and
    maybe others, as well as the Coroner's Gambit itself, are dedicated to
    Rozz.

[^1peter118]:
    The realm of corruptible things is from some translations of 1 Peter 1:18.
    See for example the [King James
    Version](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201:18&version=KJV)
    (retrieved September 19, 2013), "Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not
    redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain
    conversation received by tradition from your fathers."

[^misspellings]:
    The source of this quote (which only appears on the vinyl version) is
    correctly titled "Being Mysterious Strangers from Distant Shores", a short
    story from Emshwiller's collection Verging on the Pertinent. There are
    several other small changes from the original text (including the dropped
    period), which is as follows:

    "They have been talking about a journey into the interior. They know the
    dangers and yet already they have decided upon it. No one can talk them
    out of it. It is clear that their minds are made up. Their knapsacks are
    packed. Their guides have been chosen. They remain cool to suggestions.

[^jaipur]:
    [Jaipur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaipur) is the capital city of
    Rajasthan, India. Its nickname, the Pink City, anecdotally arose when the
    city was painted pink to celebrate the arrival of the Prince of Wales in
    1853.

[^bessiesmith]:
    This verse comes from Haunted House Blues, by the American blues great
    [Bessie Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessie_Smith), written by J.

    Jazz](http://www.redhotjazz.com/bessie.html), retrieved September 19,
    2013.

    "'Haunted House Blues' by Bessie Smith seemed like a good way of locking
    all the doors before the proceedings began on The Coroner's Gambit, if
    that's not too strained a way to put it. There was a Celine Dion
    sound-collage that was actually going to be the lead-off bit where I had
    her saying 'Made a deal with the devil' over and over, and eventually just
    'deal with the devil' a few times, but it's probably best that I left it
    at home when I went to transfer the songs from cassette to quarter-inch."

[^ghee]:
    Clarified butter, known as [ghee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghee) in
    India, is widely used in Indian food and religious rites. The most common
    pastry cooked with ghee is probably the
    [samosa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samosa), which is usually filled
    with meat and spices.

[^chariot]:
    These lines refer to the title and chorus of the popular spiritual song
    [Swing Low, Sweet
    Chariot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_Low,_Sweet_Chariot), first
    recorded in 1909 and written in 1862. The chorus is the repeated couplet,
    "Swing low, sweet chariot / Coming for to carry me home." This refers to
    [2 Kings
    2](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%202&version=HCSB),
    where Elijah is taken to heaven in a chariot.

[^moses]:
    Likely a reference to the birth of Moses. According to the Bible, when
    Moses was born in Egypt, all male Jewish children were to be killed. His
    mother therefore hid him in the rushes, where he was found and raised by
    the Pharaoh's daughter. [Exodus 2:1 --

[^joseph]:
    This sounds like a reference to Joseph, who was sold by his brothers into
    slavery to passing traders. [Genesis

[^seaboard]:
    The [Eastern

    refers to the eastern coast of the United States.
    [Atlanta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta), the capital of Georgia,
    lies a couple hundred miles off of the coast.

[^pilgrim]:
    Compare to [Matthew
    7:15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207:15&version=HCSB):
    "Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly
    are ravaging wolves." Numerous stories and fables including this motif
    have increased the fame of this verse. Holman Christian Standard Bible,

[^am]:
    The [AM band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_broadcasting) refers to one
    of the two major commercial radio bands (the other being FM). Standing for

[^elijahseries]:
    Elijah is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^elijah]:
    [Elijah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah) was a Biblical prophet in
    the 9th century BC, advocating for the Hebrew God over Baal, the
    Phoenician. He is invoked in several Jewish rituals, such as seder.

    Elijah is also notable for being one of very few people [who entered
    heaven alive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entering_Heaven_alive#Judaism)
    --- see [2 Kings
    2:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+2%3A11&version=HCSB).
    Interestingly enough, [Enoch](tlotwtc.html#enoch) is one of the rare
    others (see [Genesis
    5:22--24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+5%3A22%E2%80%9324&version=HCSB)).
    Thanks to Mairead Beeson for making me aware of this!

[^coconut]:
    I'm not aware of any ritual where coconut oil is smeared on walls --- if
    you do, please [contact me](../about.html#contact). Some of this is
    reminiscent of the story of Passover in Judaism, in which God instructed
    Moses and his followers to smear the blood of a freshly-slaughtered lamb
    on the doorposts to be spared the [10th plague of
    Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagues_of_Egypt) --- the death of
    every firstborn male:

    > The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: ... Tell the
    > whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month they must
    > each select an animal of the flock according to their fathers'
    > households, one animal per household... You are to keep it until the
    > fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembly of the community
    > of Israel will slaughter the animals at twilight. They must take some of
    > the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses
    > where they eat them... You are to eat it in a hurry; it is the Lord's
    > Passover.

    I am uncertain enough about this allusion to not include it in the [series
    of Biblical references](series.html#bible), but I do think it's worth
    considering. Thanks to Mairead Beeson for her analysis of this!

[^magnolia]:
    [Magnolia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnolia) is a genus of hundreds
    of plants with large, fragrant flowers.

[^kalasha]:
    The combination of coconut, pot, and flowers, especially in the Indian
    context of this album, is reminiscent of
    [kalasha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalasha), a metal pot used to hold
    a coconut in Hindu rituals. However, a kalasha is not boiled, nor in my
    knowledge is the coconut used on the walls, so this comparison may be
    spurious.

[^fullness]:
    The phrase, "the fullness of time", is from some translations of
    [Galatians
    4:4](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%204:4&version=KJV):
    "But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made
    of a woman, made under the law". Galatians largely concerns Biblical law.

## Trick Mirror [^nalltitle] [^seneca] ## {#mirror}

Seventeen years ago [^tutor] \\
They told me to teach him everything I know [^nero] \\
Let the fire rain down [^fire] \\
Rain down \\
Watched it flare up inside his heart \\
Saw it tearing him completely apart \\
Head to toe \\
I know

And blood will run through the streets of Rome [^rome] today [^pisonian] \\
And roll across the ocean

Fourteen years ago tonight \\
Watched him tearing through the garden killing everything in sight [^christians] \\
I let my curiosity \\
Get the best of me

I saw the sourceless anger eating at him from inside \\
No one around him to stem the rising tide \\
Evil from his head down to his feet \\
Quinines bitter, sugars sweet

And blood will run through the streets of Rome today \\
And roll across the ocean

[^nalltitle]:
    Nall incorrectly lists Trick Mirror as [Seneca's Trick
    Mirror](http://themountaingoats.net/lyrics/coroner_lyr.html#seneca),
    despite it not being listed as such anywhere else. I'm not sure of the
    origins of this title change.

[^seneca]:
    The song appears to describe the youth of the Roman tyrant
    [Nero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero) from the perspective of his
    tutor, the philosopher
    [Seneca the Younger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger).
    Seneca was forced to commit suicide in 65 AD by Nero due to his
    involvement in the Pisonian conspiracy to kill him.
    [Seneca](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/seneca/), Stanford Encyclopedia
    of Philosophy, retrieved September 19, 2013.

[^tutor]:
    Seneca began to tutor Nero in 49 AD when he was recalled from exile by
    Agrippina the Younger, Empress of Rome to Claudius. As he was forced to
    commit suicide in 65 AD, this spans 17 years (including 49 AD and 65 AD).
    This song is therefore written from the perspective of Seneca's final
    days. [Seneca](http://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/seneca.html),
    Public Broadcasting Service, retrieved September 19, 2013.

[^nero]:
    This must refer to [Nero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero), the infamous
    tyrant. Nero ruled Rome in the 50s and 60s AD until his death during a
    rebellion. Nero famously executed his mother and idled during the Great
    Fire of Rome.

[^fire]:
    Most obviously refers to a metaphorical rage inside Nero, but perhaps also
    an allusion to the aforementioned [Great Fire of
    Rome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fire_of_Rome), which was rumored
    to be at least ignored by by Nero, or worse, caused by him to make room
    for his architectural projects.

[^rome]:
    [Rome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome) is both the current capital of
    Italy and the historical capital of the Roman Empire. Founded in 753 BC,
    Rome is one of the oldest cities in the world.

[^pisonian]:
    According to the above calculations, Seneca would be near his death during
    the time of this song. This then likely refers to the [Pisonian
    conspiracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisonian_conspiracy), an
    assassination attempt against Nero in 65 AD. Seneca was suspected to be
    involved with the assassination plan and was ordered by Nero to commit
    suicide. If this song takes place before the assassination attempt was
    intended to be carried out, this line could refer to the blood of Nero; if
    afterwards, it perhaps refers to Seneca's blood from slitting his wrists,
    the method he used to kill himself.

[^christians]:
    Nero used his gardens to execute Christians, burning them for light, torn
    by animals, crucified, and otherwise murdered, blaming them for the Great
    Fire of Rome.

    "... Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on
    a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace...
    Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. Covered with the skins of
    beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or
    were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination,
    when daylight had expired.

    "Nero offered his gardens for the spectacle, and was exhibiting a show in
    the circus, while he mingled with the people in the dress of a charioteer
    or stood aloft on a car." --- Tacitus, Annals, [Book XV, Chapter
    44](http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/annals.11.xv.html). Translated by
    Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb, The Internet Classics
    Archive, retrieved September 20, 2013.

    The Great Fire of Rome occurred in 64 AD, the year before Seneca died.
    However, John describes these murders as occurring 14 years prior, in 51
    AD, shortly after he returned to Rome to tutor and advise Nero. This
    corresponds roughly to when Nero entered political life as a proconsul,
    according to Tacitus' Annals ([Book XII, Chapter
    41](http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/annals.8.xii.html)). I am not sure of
    the significance of this discrepancy in timeline; perhaps he is assuming
    that Nero murdered people in his gardens at other times as well, or is
    referring to the first times that Seneca witnessed Nero's violence.

## Island Garden Song [^islandjohn] ## {#island}

I will sail \\
To the far shore \\
And I will chop \\
A hole in the hull too big to repair

And I will turn \\
The soil with my hands \\
And I will make \\
My home there

My garden will grow so high \\
My garden will grow so high \\
That I will be completely hidden

And I will go \\
Where I will go \\
And I will jettison \\
All dead weight

And I will use \\
These words for kindling \\
And I will sleep \\
By the garden gate

My garden will grow so high \\
My garden will grow so high \\
That I will be completely hidden

[^islandjohn]:
    "... it's one of those songs that I sort of wrote and didn't ask myself
    what I was writing, just sort of go through it, find some chords, and keep
    going. But I'm pretty certain that this is a song about the need for
    isolation and the possibility of finding something in there that you
    didn't know you needed." --- McCabe's Guitar Shop, Santa Monica, June 30,

## The Coroner's Gambit ## {#coroner}

When Death came calling today \\
I heard the gentle grace of his cadences \\
I couldn't say no \\

When he showed me his new silk scarves \\
Laid out on the shiny black plastic tray \\
Couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say no \\
I couldn't say no

And I'm sorry I couldn't \\
You know how badly I wanted to \\
Didn't want, didn't want, didn't want, didn't want, didn't want to lose you

But his smile was dazzling \\
And his eyes were sparkling \\
Like moonlight \\
On the water at midnight \\
Couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say no \\
I couldn't say no

The sun came up above the strange white plain \\
Blood-red flowers all wet with rain \\
And the spirit wasn't really willing anymore \\
But the flesh was very, very strong [^spiritflesh]

And I've got very little money left and I've got no sense \\
But I'll have none of your goddamned impudence \\
Sun came up above the new white fields \\
Everything was new again

Pure power stripped of meaning \\
Sky burning \\
Spring cleaning

Daisies on the hillside like cancer on the skin \\
Pretty little yellow eyes that flutter in the wind \\
I'd be grateful my children aren't here to see this if you'd ever seen fit to give me children

And my defenses may be working with a skeleton crew \\
But I'll be skinned alive before I'll take this from you \\
The sun came up above the ocean out west \\
All the colors of the rainbow

Stand up straight you can see the house leaning \\
Day breaking \\
Spring cleaning

    people's love for one another degenerates into a horrible poisonous
    hatred. And when they think about how much --- how good it was at one
    point, it just --- you want to say it breaks their hearts, but at the same
    time you know it doesn't, because they just keep plugging along, and you
    keep saying, 'Oh boy, wouldn't it be great if somebody could just kill you
    because, you know, you can't kill yourself, you know that's wrong, and you
    know it would be fucked up and all your friends would be mad at you and so
    would your family, but if some kind, well-meaning guy would just come
    along and end it for you, you know, blame's off you.' That's what this
    song is about." --- Terrastock II, Custer Avenue Stages, San Francisco,

## Family Happiness [^familyjohn] ## {#family}

As we cruised across \\
The Canadian border \\
You reached into your handbag \\
Pulled out a microcassette recorder \\
Started quoting Tolstoy into the machine [^familyjohn] \\
I had no idea what you meant \\
Guess I'm supposed to figure these things out \\
Or maybe it's supposed to be self-evident \\
But I've gone feral \\
And I don't speak the language anymore \\
We're headed deep into the forest \\
I got the pedal to the floor \\
The engine shudders like a dying man \\
When you reach out to grab my hand \\
You could bring out all your weapons \\
You can't make me go to war

Long winding Canadian highways \\
Innumerable evergreens \\
Weather forecast on the AM radio \\
Says, "We'll be expecting highs in the low teens" \\
When I mouth my silent curses at you \\
I can see my breath \\
I hope the stars don't even come out tonight \\
I hope we both freeze to death \\
Look at the person I've turned into, tell me how you like him now \\
No standards of any kind to break, no creeds to disavow \\
I am right here where you want me \\
Do what you brought me out here for \\
You can arm me to the teeth \\
You can't make me go to war

## Onions ## {#onions}

The last white slabs of snow \\
Melted off seven weeks ago \\
And the geese are headed north again \\
Through the tightening sky, and I \\
Can feel my heart in my throat again \\
New onions growing in the ground

The cows come gingerly out of the barn \\
When they see that the ground is warm \\
They pick up a little speed, it makes me feel so good \\
And I feel it rushing down my throat, fresh blood \\
I head out onto the earth, its cold heart is melting \\
I don't know if I can stand it \\
Springtime's coming, that means you'll be coming back around \\

## "Bluejays and Cardinals" [^rozz] [^quotes] ## {#bluejays}

Bluejays and Cardinals all come out to play [^baseball] \\
The highway traffic gets out of your way

Skies clear up if they're overcast \\
Pit bulls are gentle when you come past

Stars come out of hiding for you \\
And I would too, but this world couldn't hold you \\
You slipped free \\
Without me

The new sheen over everything \\
When you open up your mouth to sing

Baseballs travel faster when you watch them fly \\
Apples fatten on the trees when you walk by

You bring something unreplaceable to each and every day \\
Or you used to anyway, but this world couldn't hold you \\
And you slipped free \\
Yeah, this world couldn't hold you \\
You slipped free \\
Without me

[^quotes]:
    The quotation marks are in part a tribute to Rozz. When asked what they
    signify, John replied, "The answer is actually really simple, but I'm
    going to pay tribute to my late friend Rozz by not telling. Rozz's band
    (Christian Death) had an album whose title was in quotes ("Ashes"), and
    his answer regarding those quotation marks was one of the less satisfying
    answers I've ever been given about anything." ---  [Heavy Metal, Ephemera,

    National League [St. Louis
    Cardinals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals). Given that
    they are in separate leagues under Major League Baseball, the teams would
    only play each other in the World Series, the championship game, a matchup

And then the static roared again \\
Hungry for blood \\
I heard the rain falling from the rainspout \\
Down, down into the sweet, wet mud \\
And you punched out all the windows \\
And the wind began to wail \\
And you gathered your hair behind your head \\
Like God was gonna catch you by the ponytail \\

[^fraud]:
    [Insurance fraud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_fraud) is
    committed by trying to dishonestly scam an insurance company into giving a
    payout without actually meeting the payout conditions. Here, it sounds
    like life insurance or homeowners' insurance fraud is being committed,
    where a death is faked or a house is destroyed for insurance money.

[^cancun]:
    [Cancún](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancún) is a Mexican city known for
    its beauty and popularity as a vacation spot.

[^train]:
    At the end of the song, you can hear a train pass by. As John describes:

    "She \[Lalitree\] wanted a free-standing house and not an apartment, we
    didn't have any money, so we wound up with a place that cost \$270 a month
    in Colo. At the train tracks. At the crossing. If you listen to that
    album, The Coroner's Gambit, there's a song, Insurance Fraud #2, where you
    hear a sound effect, it sounds like a train? It's a train. It's two
    trains, 'cause they came both ways. And most of the songs that the trains
    ruined, I discarded, but I was like, 'Nah, you know, that's all right for
    that song." --- City Arts and Lectures, Herbst Theatre, San Francisco,

    "This is a song about being in a motel. This is a very familiar story to
    so many people, that's why I share it, because it's a universal experience
    that people know about. When you're in Southern Florida in your motel and

[^mango]:
    John has confirmed that this is a pun on the [Alphonso

    forums, [John
    commented](http://www.mountain-goats.com/forums/read.php?2,37017,37026#msg-37026),
    "ten years I had to wait for somebody to make this connection and it took
    a guy from a country that saw its first mango in 1987 to do it / Ireland
    for great win yet again". Alphonso mango is a sweet variety of mango grown
    mainly in India.

[^playitasitlays]:
    This phrase is used extensively in English speech, particularly in
    gambling and athletics, but likely originates from the rules of golf. In
    the United States Golf Association Rules of Golf, [Rule 13, Ball Played As
    It Lies](http://www.usga.org/Rule-Books/Rules-of-Golf/Rule-13/), states,
    "The ball must be played as it lies, except as otherwise provided in the
    Rules" (retrieved September 20, 2013).

    Simultaneously, this is an homage the Joan Didion novel [Play It as It
    Lays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_It_as_It_Lays). To my ear, John
    subtly confirms this homage at City Arts and Lectures, Herbst Theatre, San
    Francisco, February 24, 2009.

[^tampabay]:
    [Tampa Bay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay) is a large estuary in
    western Florida near Tampa.

## We Were Patriots ## {#patriots}

Clear sky over Calcutta [^calcutta] [^coverphoto] \\
Warm wind \\
Dvořák [^dvorak] on the shortwave \\
Clear signal coming in

La la la \\
La la la la la \\
La la \\
La la la la la la la

Long vowels spill like liquid from your mouth \\
I hang on every word you say \\
An army of transistor radios on the bookshelf \\
Left on all day \\
Let them play \\
Yeah, let 'em all play on and on and on \\
Let 'em all play longer and louder \\
Long after you're gone

La la \\
La la la la la \\
La la \\
La la la la la

Clear sky sheltering our fragile little house \\
Listening to the radio all the time \\
Your hand on my forehead as though to check for a fever, yeah \\
Big plans in mind

La la la la \\
La la la la la \\
La la la la \\
La la la la la la la \\
La la \\
La la la la la la \\
Yeah, yeah

    Incidentally, the cover of The Coroner's Gambit depicts Calcutta with an
    apparently cloudy sky overhead.

[^dvorak]:
    [Antonín
    Dvořák](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton%C3%ADn_Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k) was a
    famous Czech composer. He is mentioned elsewhere in the Coroner's Gambit
    via the mention of the [Slavonic Dances](#fn:slavonic), one of his pieces,
    as the subtitle to this album.
