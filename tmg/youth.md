## Amy aka Spent Gladiator 1 ## {#amy}

Do every stupid thing that makes you feel alive \\
Do every stupid thing to try to drive the dark away \\
Let people call you crazy for the choices that you make \\
Find limits past the limits, jump in front of trains all day \\
And stay alive \\
Just stay alive

Play with matches if you think you need to play with matches \\
Seek out the hidden places where the fire burns hot and bright \\
Find where the heat's unbearable and stay there if you have to \\
Don't hurt anybody on your way up to the light \\
And stay alive \\
Just stay alive

People might laugh at your tattoos \\
When they do, get new ones in completely garish hues

I hide down in my corner because I like my corner \\
I am happy where the vermin play \\
Make up magic spells, we wear them like protective shells
Landmines on the battlefield, find the one safe way \\
And stay alive \\
Just stay alive \\
Just stay alive

## Lakeside View Apartments Suite ## {#lakeside}

Downtown north past the airport \\
A dream in switchgrass and concrete \\
Three gray floors of smoky windows \\
Facing the street

Michael pulls the blinds back up \\
Stares blankly down at the intersection \\
Watching for the guy who's got the angel dust \\
Crystal clear connection

Days like dominoes, all in a line \\
We cheer for the home team every time \\
Lakeside view \\
Lakeside view \\
Lakeside view for my whole crew

Most nights now sleep in the kitchen \\
Keep my face cool on the floor \\
And John, John comes by to drop off his envelopes \\
Still playing postman after all these years

Pull down my army surplus jacket \\
Dig through some drawers to find the keys \\
Emerge transformed in a million years \\
From days like these

Under each eye, little greasepaint smudge \\
You can't judge us, you're not the judge \\
Lakeside view \\
Lakeside view \\
Lakeside view for my whole crew

And just before I leave \\
I throw up in the sink \\
One whole life recorded \\
In disappearing ink

And Ray left a message thumbtacked to the door \\
I don't even bother trying to read them anymore \\
Lakeside view \\
Lakeside view \\
Lakeside view for my whole crew

## Cry for Judas ## {#judas}

Some things you do just to see \\
How bad they'll make you feel \\
Sometimes you try to freeze time \\
'Til those thoughts are a blur of spinning wheels

But I am just a broken machine \\
And I do things that I don't really mean \\
Long black night, morning frost \\
I'm still here, but all is lost

Speed up to the precipice \\
And then slam on the brakes \\
Some people crash two or three times \\
And then learn from their mistakes

But we are the ones who don't slow down at all \\
And there's nobody there to catch us when we fall \\
Long black night, morning frost \\
I'm still here, but all is lost

Feel the storm every night, hope it passes by \\
Hallucinate a shady grove where Judas went to die

Unfurl the black velvet altar cloth \\
Draw a white chalk Baphomet \\
Mistreat your altar boys long enough \\
And this is what you get

Sad and angry, can't learn how to behave \\
Still won't know how in the darkness of the grave \\
Long black night, morning frost \\
I'm still here, but all is lost

## Harlem Roulette ## {#harlem}

Unknown engines underneath the city \\
Steam pushing up in billows through the grates \\
Frankie Lymon's tracking Seabreeze in a studio in Harlem \\
It's 1968

Just a pair of tunes to hammer out \\
Everybody's off the clock by ten \\
The loneliest people in the whole wide world \\
Are the ones you're never going to see again

Feel so free when I hit the avenue \\
Nothing like a New York summer night \\
Every dream's a good dream, even awful dreams are good dreams \\
If you're doing it right

Remember soaring higher than the clouds \\
Get pretty sentimental now and then \\
The loneliest people in the whole wide world \\
Are the ones you're never going to see again \\

And four hours north of Portland, a radio flips on \\
And some no one from the future remembers that you're gone

Armies massing in the dusky distance \\
Ghosted in the ribbon microphone \\
Leave a little mark on something, maybe \\
Take the secret circuit home

Nothing in the shadows but the shadow hands \\
Reaching out to sad, young, frightened men \\
The loneliest people in the whole wide world \\
Are the ones you're never going to see again \\
Yeah, the loneliest people in the whole wide world \\
Are the ones you're never going to see again

## White Cedar ## {#cedar}

Like a star come down to walk the Earth in radiant array \\
I saw the light of my spirit descend the other day \\
I was standing by the bus stop on Northeast 33rd \\
When I got the word

I will be made a new creature \\
One bright day \\
I don't have to be afraid \\
Speed that day on its way \\
And you can't tell me what my spirit tells me isn't true \\
Can you

Woke up on lockdown one more time, my visions won't ever learn \\
But I see the light that much clearer every time I return \\
Forge my armor in the old fire, my spirit sings loud and clear \\
Even in here

I'll be reborn someday, someday \\
If I wait long enough \\
I don't have to be afraid \\
I don't want to be afraid \\
And you can't tell me what my spirit tells me isn't true \\
Can you

## Until I Am Whole ## {#whole}

Sunset on Snohomish \\
Burn the tree line down \\
Hold my hopes underwater \\
Stand there and watch them drown \\
Fishing out their bodies \\
From the bathroom sink \\
Leave them in a bucket \\
'Til they start to stink

I think I'll stay here \\
'Til I feel whole again \\
I don't know when

Trout swim past the fishing lines \\
Sky gets dark and close \\
Cars start up and make \\
Their nightly exodus \\
On a picnic bench alone \\
Watch the sky go dark \\
Dig my nails into my hands \\
Hope it leaves a mark

I think I'll stay here \\
'Til I feel whole again \\
I don't know when

## Night Light [^nightseries] ## {#night}

Pull my mask so tight \\
'Til it pinches my skin \\
Nerves strung so high \\
I am a mandolin \\
Jenny calls from Montana [^nightjenny] \\
She's only passing through \\
Probably never see her again in this life I guess \\
Not sure what I'm gonna do

Plug a night light in \\
Leave the porch light on \\
Because the small dark corners \\
Have designs on me \\
Live like an outlaw \\
Clutching gold coins in his claw

Room full of ambitious young policemen \\
Everybody trying to make his mark \\
I was a red dot blinking on a screen up overhead \\
And then the room went dark \\
Dream of maybe waking up someday \\
And wanting you less than I do \\
This is a dream though \\
It's never gonna come true

Plug a night light in \\
Leave the porch light on \\
Because the small dark corners \\
Are establishing a colony \\
Live like an outlaw \\
Clutching gold coins in his claw

Can't ever set aside the sweetness \\
Of the days before the crews put up the border \\
Fields full of wet rain \\
Cling tight to their memory forever \\
Think about Montana when I close my eyes \\
Possibly Jenny's headed east \\
Count a couple of stray hopes out loud \\
May their numbers one day be increased

Plug a night light in \\
Leave the porch light on \\
Because the small dark corners \\
Breathe like heavy animals \\
Live like an outlaw \\
Clutching gold coins in his claw

    explicit that this is the same Jenny as in the All Hail West Texas track,
    in meaning if not literal personhood. I Only Listen to the Mountain Goats,

## The Diaz Brothers ## {#diaz}

Cops and robbers, strictly bargain line \\
Spent the wet night tracking visions through the pines \\
Draw my arms into my hospital gown \\
See the sky open up and rain down \\
Rain down

Mercy for the Diaz brothers \\
Mercy for the Diaz brothers

Hear my rivals on the western wind \\
Hard to know who might or might not be your friend \\
Work by the plutonium light \\
Forbidden rosary prayers all night \\
All night

Mercy for the Diaz brothers \\
Mercy for the Diaz brothers

Beam of the flashlight \\
All night in the woods \\
Hunt us like dogs \\
And then string us up for good

Keep one step ahead of enemies \\
Foretell worse things than such frightful nights as these \\
Lead us to the beach by our hands \\
And bury us there in the sand

Mercy for the Diaz brothers \\
Mercy for the Diaz brothers \\
Mercy for the Diaz brothers \\
Mercy for the Diaz brothers

## Counterfeit Florida Plates ## {#counterfeit}

Steal some sunscreen \\
From the CVS \\
Use too much \\
And make a great big mess \\
Wait where shadows mask or hide my scent \\
So many so-called friends \\
Working for the government

Dig through the trash \\
Sleep on the grates \\
And watch for the cars \\
With the counterfeit Florida plates

Scribble cyphers on the library bathroom wall \\
Map a path from here to home \\
Can't quite catch 'em all \\
Calculate magnetic north \\
And turn the other way \\
Wait for the coming disaster \\
I could do this all day

Dig through the trash \\
Sleep on the grates \\
And watch for the cars \\
With the counterfeit Florida plates

It seems like everyone's cut me free \\
And left me to the tender cares of my faceless enemy

Feel so hungry \\
Probably pass out soon \\
Look for a tree to lean up against \\
Whistle a tuneless tune \\
This may be the night my point men finally come \\
Wait for the fog to catch up with me \\
So I can at least feel numb

Dig through the trash \\
Sleep on the grates \\
And watch for the cars \\
With the counterfeit Florida plates \\
With the counterfeit Florida plates \\
With the counterfeit Florida plates

## In Memory of Satan ## {#satan}

Got my paintbox out last night \\
Stayed up late and wrecked this place \\
Woke up on the floor again \\
Cellphone stuck to the side of my face

Dead space on the other end \\
Perfect howl of emptiness \\
Cast my gaze around the room \\
Someone needs to clean up this mess

Tape up the windows \\
Call in a favor from an old friend

Make some scratches on my floor \\
Crawl down on my hands and knees \\
In old movies people scream \\
Choking on their fists when they see shadows like these

But no one screams 'cause it's just me \\
Locked up in myself \\
Never gonna get free

Something sacred, something blue \\
Cannons in the harbor dawn \\
Crawled down here to dig for bones \\
One more season then I'm gone

Black drapes over the crosses \\
Call in a favor from an old friend

## Spent Gladiator 2 ## {#gladiator}

*"And."*

Like a spent gladiator \\
Crawling in the Colosseum dust \\
Who can count on his remaining limbs \\
All the people he can trust \\
Like the one who stands behind him \\
Cheering him on \\
Ecstatic when he stands defiant \\
Wild with abandon when he's gone

Just stay alive \\
Keep your eyes on the pay line

Like a village on the steppe \\
About to get collectivized \\
When the men emerge with rifles from the haystack \\
Everybody looks surprised \\
Like the mice in the forgotten grain \\
Way up on the top shelf \\
Like someone who's found a small town to escape to \\
Keeps one eye on his abandoned former self

Stay in the game \\
Just try to play through the pain \\
Like a fighter who's been told it's finally time for him to quit \\
Show up in shining colors \\
And then stand there and get hit

Like the clock that ticks in Dresden \\
When the whole town's been destroyed \\
Like the nagging flash of insight \\
You're always desperate to avoid \\
Like the bloody-knuckled gunman \\
Still stationed at the breach \\
Like that board game with the sliders \\
And the children on the beach

Stay alive \\
Maybe spit some blood at the camera \\
Just stay alive \\
Stay forever alive

## Transcendental Youth ## {#transcendental}

Cold through broken baseboards \\
I despise this town \\
Snow on the sunroof \\
Two stories down \\
Hold hands \\
Wish the snow away \\
Rise in the darkness \\
Of the gathering day

Sing \\
Sing for ourselves alone \\
Speak into \\
The microphone

Cedar smudge our headbands \\
And take to the skies \\
Soar ever upwards \\
On air gone black with flies \\
Shroud ourselves in the cosmos \\
Let the music play \\
Bright star of the morning \\
Shine on his rising way

Sing \\
In the night \\
In the nameless dark \\
Father long gone \\
But we bear his mark

Learn some secrets \\
Never tell \\
Stay sick \\
Don't get well

Clutch those broken headboards \\
Ride the highest wave \\
Dusky diamonds shining \\
In the far depths of the cave \\
Try to explain ourselves \\
Babble on and on \\
By the time you receive this \\
We'll be gone

Sing \\
Sing high \\
While the fire climbs \\
Sing one for the old times

## Tomorrow ## {#tomorrow}

*"Tomorrow. Lyric by Martin Charnin. Music by Charles Strouse."*

The sun'll come out \\
Tomorrow \\
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow \\
There'll be sun

Just thinking about \\
Tomorrow \\
Clears away the cobwebs \\
And the sorrow \\
'Til there's none

When I'm stuck with a day \\
That's gray \\
And lonely \\
I just stick out my chin \\
And grin \\
And say

Oh, the sun'll come out \\
Tomorrow \\
So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow \\
Come what may

Tomorrow, tomorrow \\
I love ya, tomorrow \\
You're always a day away

The sun'll come out \\
Tomorrow \\
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow \\
There'll be sun

Just thinkin' about \\
Tomorrow \\
Clears away the cobwebs \\
And the sorrow \\
'Til there's none

When I'm stuck with a day \\
That's gray \\
And lonely \\
I just stick out my chin \\
And grin \\
And say

Oh, the sun'll come out \\
Tomorrow \\
Oh, I gotta hang on 'til tomorrow \\
Come what may

Tomorrow, tomorrow \\
I love ya, tomorrow \\
You're only a day away
