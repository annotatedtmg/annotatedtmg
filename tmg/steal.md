## Steal Smoked Fish ## {#steal}

*"Not quite. Two, three, and."*

Across the Burnside bridge before \\
Anyone shot their movies there \\
We hid from the whipping rain \\
When we had run out of cocaine \\
Dispatch down to Plaid Pantry \\
Two on point, and two on sentry \\
Ah, the joys that the lesser days bring \\
Make you throw back your heads and sing

God bless all petty thieves \\
With tins of oysters up their sleeves \\
Feast when you can \\
And dream when there's nothing to feast on

Across a different bridge today \\
Over the river and down Broadway \\
Feels so good to have you here \\
Some of you will be dead next year \\
I see your destinies above you \\
Like angels who don't love you \\
Let them kiss you and hold you tight \\
As long as the money's right

God bless all my old friends \\
And god bless me too, why pretend? \\
Feast when you can \\
And dream when there's nothing to feast on

God bless the guys from my old neighborhood \\
Gone past the point where any blessings can do them any good

Attach the C-4 where you must \\
Disappear in a cloud of dust \\
But spare a thought for what it covers up \\
Pour a triple and raise your cup \\
We were here once, me and my friends \\
But we destroyed all of the evidence \\
And vanished into the night \\
At least we got that one right

God bless us, all of us \\
We who learn to shun the light \\
God bless all vampires every night \\
Feast when you can \\
Feast when you can \\
Feast when you can \\
Feast when you can


## In the Shadow of the Western Hills ## {#hills}

Spread out the old maps on the floor \\
Plot the course of the infection \\
Trace from its beginnings to the present \\
Is there no one here who's making this connection \\
Feral cats out by the trash cans \\
To the true believer, everything's a sign

Scrape the pigments from the baseboards \\
In the shadow of the western hills \\
And paint my vision on my body \\
In the shadow of the western hills

Bleak rose-petaled sky in two dimensions \\
Black treeline a blade that cuts across it all \\
Can't seem to sleep or find my appetite \\
Since I got home from the hospital \\
Call up Rebecca, maybe try to explain \\
But she hangs up while I'm still talking, I walk out into the rain

Wonder from the alley to the darkness \\
Sink down completely, leave no trace \\
Trapped beneath the surface of the ice again \\
Lie still with the moonlight on my face \\
Wait for the wolves to keep their promise \\
Listen for their footfalls on the snow

I can't hear things clearly to be honest \\
In the shadow of the western hills \\
He gets most healed that waits the longest \\
In the shadow of the western hills
