[^bedside]:
    Bedside Recordings 1.2 is a small, 7" split EP between the Mountain Goats
    and John Vanderslice. This split was the second release of Ben Gibbard's
    (of Death Cab for Cutie) short-lived record label Bedside Recordings;
    Volume 1.1 featured David Bazan and Casey Foubert (both from Pedro the
    Lion), and to the best of my knowledge a third volume was never made. Both
    songs on the album are titled on a military theme.

## Soft Targets [^softjohn] [^target]  ## {#soft}

You cry when you get drunk \\
And I can't find the right things to say \\
Sooner or later you'll start breaking plates \\
And I'll do what I can to stay out of your way

There is nobody innocent here \\
I've got more blood on my hands than you do \\
It's you and it's me and the baby makes three \\
Yeah, but we've got our love to carry us through \\
We've got our love to carry us through

I cry when I'm hungry \\
Something is wrong with my brain \\
And the ghost of our future's awake in the attic \\
He moans and he wails as he rattles his chains

We embrace on the floor in the kitchen \\
Emissaries from neighboring lands \\
When I hunt down the vampire that did this to us \\
I will rip out his heart with my hands \\
I will rip out his heart with my hands

[^softjohn]:
    "It's a love song, after a manner of speaking... Well, here's the thing.
    In, you know, the US military, has this way of coming up with nice ways of
    describing bad things. So, you have 'hard targets' --- that's buildings,
    and military installations, and streets, right? And then you have 'soft
    targets' --- and that's people, right." --- Mains d'Oeuvres, Mofo
    Festival, Paris, June 27, 2003.

    Although some debate exists among fans as to whether this song belongs in
    the [Alpha couple series](series.html#alpha), as I've found nothing to
    confirm that it belongs in the series, I have left it out.

[^target]:
    A [soft target](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_target) is a military
    term for any easy-to-destroy target, that is, something they want to
    destroy but which isn't defended or protected.
