## Black Pear Tree [^blackpearjohn] ## {#blackpear}

I dug a hole and filled it up with compost \\
Rested on the cool grass for a minute \\
I saw the future in a dream last night \\
There's nothing in it

I set the sapling in the hole \\
Started gently tamping down the dirt \\
I saw the future in a dream last night \\
Somebody's gonna get hurt, somebody's gonna get hurt \\
I hope it's not me \\
But I suspect it's going to have to be

I dug my heels in for the winter \\
And I waited for the snow \\
But something was stuck up in the clouds, something was stuck up there \\
I couldn't let go

And when its time came I could see it happen \\
Blossoms black and sweet as Texas crude \\
I saw the future flowering like a ruptured vessel \\
Somebody's gonna get screwed \\
It won't be me \\
Someday I am going to walk out of here free

[^blackpearjohn]:
    John has said that this song was written in an ER in Stockholm that he
    visited thinking he was going to die from a heart attack. For example,
    listen to the banter at Somerville Theater, Somerville, March 25, 2009.

    "We were in Sweden in the back of a very small tour car... and then I
    start wondering why my chest hurts... I went to the ER and I'm sitting
    there waiting to talk to the doctor, well, waiting for the doctor to tell
    me that I needed to get right with God and my friends and family because I
    only have seven days or something like that, and I wrote down some lyrics.
    And then I put them away, you know, because when I got finished he told me
    I had Lutheran syndrome, as he said... 'You think you have to pay for the
    things you did before.' And I would take issue, not that I'm a doctor, but
    it's 'I *know* I have to pay.' Anyway, the better part of a year passed,
    and I had forgotten about most of it, I'm flipping through a notebook
    looking for something to do, and I ran across the lyrics I had written
    when in my gut I was pretty certain that I was going to have to go home
    and tell my wife that I was sorry I smoked for so long, better go find
    somebody cute 'cause I'm going to rot in the grave."

    See also this banter: "I wrote this lyric in an Emergency Room in Sweden
    when I was having chest pains... I went through a period of a couple of
    years there where I would say that I don't know what was wrong with me,
    but I do... at the time I was in a pretty hard place, and I was landing in
    the hospital pretty regularly, and this is called Black Pear Tree." ---
    Swedish-American Hall, San Francisco, June 27, 2012

## Mosquito Repellent [^mosquitojohn] [^writingmosquito] ## {#mosquito}

All day, all day \\
Sweeping out the shards \\
Do what I have to do \\
Try to start anew, but I

Thought of you twice \\
Couldn't help myself \\
I don't know what I need \\
Clutching and fingering the rosary beads

But I try, try, try \\
But I know \\
I can't let go \\
But I know \\
I can't let go

TV upstairs \\
Leave it on all night \\
Do what I have to do \\
Add, subtract, and divide by two, but my

Eyes light up \\
At cops and robbers time \\
I hope the bad guys win \\
I hope the good guys get their skulls bashed in

And I try, try, try \\
But I know \\
I can't let go \\
I can't let go

[^mosquitojohn]:
    "When a young man begins to write indie rock songs, he often thinks there
    are few figures more romantic that he could cut than that of a lover who
    has been wronged and who is wearing his pain like a great mask with which
    to torment the woman who he once loved... One generally, with noteworthy
    exceptions, outgrows this writing tendency on account of it's juvenile.
    But every once in a while you want to go revisit that tortured lover whose
    torturedness is so massively tortured that no one could really comprehend
    the extent of the torture... This is the first song I've written in that
    voice in a long time." --- Music Hall of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, November
    8, 2008

[^writingmosquito]:
    John states on a number of occasions that this song was written unusually
    in that Kaki King wrote the music and then John wrote the lyrics to the
    music, as opposed to him writing a rough idea of the music along with
    lyrics and sending it to someone to arrange it. See for example the banter
    at Republic, New Orleans, November 3, 2008, and Theatre of the Living
    Arts, Philadelphia, November 11, 2008.

## Bring Our Curses Home [^cursesjohn] [^bringourcurses] [^katrina] ## {#curses}

Stray shards of vinyl siding \\
Hit the windshield coming down \\
On the gridlocked freeway \\
Headed for Houston out of town [^houston]

We were sad to see it sinking \\
Up on the Jumbotron [^jumbotron] \\
Balconies in higher places \\
Gone, gone, gone

Young Romans at the city walls \\
Scavenging for scraps \\
Riding out the amnesia \\
Filling in the gaps

Grab hold of my hammer \\
Try to bring down the Superdome [^superdome] \\
On that rainy day \\
When I bring my curses home

Water floods the pharmacy \\
People sliding down the aisles \\
Emerging into the moonlit night \\
All smiles, all smiles

Wished I was down there with them \\
Reaching for that third rail \\
Saw them on the TV though \\
As they herded them down to jail

That night someone brought some shoes in \\
From Los Angeles or Portland I forget \\
Mad scramble for the boxes \\
Everything got wet

Wingless broken insects \\
Trapped in honeycomb \\
On that wasteful day \\
When I bring my curses home

[^cursesjohn]:
    "This takes place a little further west than that \[referring to
    Atlanta\], and it's called Bring Our Curses Home." --- Bluebird Theater,
    Denver, October 17, 2008

[^bringourcurses]:
    I can think of two potential origins of this name (which are probably just
    as likely as John making it up without knowing of either of these
    connections --- I have no evidence that these inspired the song title):

    1. In J. R. R. Tolkien's superb novel [*The
    Hobbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit), the story opens with
    Bilbo Baggins involuntarily entertaining the wizard Gandalf and a company
    of thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield, who are attempting to
    convince the reluctant hobbit to join them on their quest to recover their
    kingdom and riches from the dragon Smaug. In explaining this to Bilbo,
    Thorin tells him:

        "But we have never forgotten our stolen treasure. And even now, when I
        will allow we have a good bit laid by and are not so badly off" ---
        here Thorin stroked the gold chain round his neck --- "we still mean
        to get it back, and to bring our curses home to Smaug --- if we can."

        Tolkien, J. R. R. (1937). *The Hobbit*. Reprinted 2007. New York:
        Houghton Mifflin Company. ISBN 0618968636

    2. As John is an avid metal fan, it may relate to the 1998 album [*Bring
    Our Curses
    Home*](https://www.discogs.com/Nema-Bring-Our-Curses-Home/master/358291),
    released on Sound Pollution Records by Ann Arbor metal band .Nema.
    Although this feels to me like something of a stretch, even given John's
    love of death metal, stranger references have happened in the Mountain
    Goats canon.

    However, as neither of these clearly connect to this particular song, the
    title is perhaps most likely unrelated.

[^katrina]:
    I have been unable to find any more descriptive banter or interviews than
    [the above](#fn:cursesjohn) regarding this song. However, given his
    description of where this takes place and the content of the song
    (including the Jumbotron, Superdome, flooding, evacuation to Houston, and
    so on), I can't help but assume that this song describes the immediate
    aftermath of [Hurricane
    Katrina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina) in August 2005.

[^houston]:
    Assuming my interpretation of this as a song about Hurricane Katrina is
    correct, this could easily refer to the [evacuation of the New Orleans
    Superdome to the
    Astrodome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliant_Astrodome#Hurricane_Katrina)
    in Houston, Texas.

[^jumbotron]:
    A genericized trademark referring to a large television, usually in a
    sports arena.

[^superdome]:
    The Superdome is an extremely large sports arena in New Orleans. During
    Hurricane Katrina, it was [used to
    shelter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_of_Hurricane_Katrina_on_the_Louisiana_Superdome)
    New Orleans citizens that were unable to evacuate the city. Disastrous
    conditions, violence, lack of clean water, sanitation, supplies, medical
    staff, or other essentials contributed to the catastrophe. The Superdome
    was eventually evacuated when it flooded and those sheltered by it were
    moved to the Astrodome in Houston.

## Supergenesis [^supergenesisjohn] [^supergenseries] [^adams] ## {#supergenesis}

In the twinkling of an eye \\
My sentence gets passed \\
And I drop to the ground and I go \\
Slithering through the grass

Carving out \\
Battle lines \\
As I crawl

Find a hollow branch to rest in \\
Slip inside \\
Wait for mice to poke their heads in \\
Jaw hinged open wide

Hang by \\
My tail \\
Listening for the call

'Cause someday, someday \\
The call will sound \\
We all, all \\
Are gonna get up from the ground

Feel the wet leaves pressed against me \\
Cling like drowning men \\
Try to hoist myself upright \\
Again, try again

Hold on \\
To the memories \\
All night

And where my arms and legs once sprouted \\
Skin is smooth and slick \\
Rub the smooth spots on some rough rocks \\
I feel cold and sick

Hold on \\
To the battle plan \\
Hold tight

'Cause someday, someday \\
The call will sound \\
And we all, we all \\
Are gonna get up from the ground

[^supergenesisjohn]:
    "This song is a song sung from the point of view of the serpent \[in the
    Garden of Eden\] shortly after he gets his walking papers." --- Republic,
    New Orleans, November 3, 2008. See also the banter at Park West, Chicago,
    October 13, 2008, and Theatre of the Living Arts, Philadelphia, November
    7, 2008.

[^supergenseries]:
    Supergenesis is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^adams]:
    A.K.M. Adam links this song together with other songs describing
    serpents and in one occasion alludes to it being religious in nature.
    This latter description happens to be correct (see the [above
    banter](#fn:supergenesisjohn)), but I don't agree that the song
    necessarily refers to the same thing as snakes in other Mountain Goats
    songs. Adam, A.K.M. (2011). ['What these cryptic symbols mean': quotation,
    allusion, and John Darnielle's biblical
    interpretation](http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/45247/1/45247.pdf). *Biblical
    Interpretation* 19: 109 -- 128.

## Roger Patterson Van [^pattersondeath] ## {#patterson}

Kelly [^kelly] said the van was streaked \\
With broken sides of you \\
Tapes and magazines \\
All your goodness beaming through \\
Sorting through your suitcase \\
By the highway in the sun \\
Somewhere in Louisiana [^pattersondeath] \\
When you really need to run \\
Your legs will bend and buckle \\
There is nowhere to go \\
So you walk sideways

Two sad young men one February [^pattersondeath] \\
Digging through a wreck \\
Cleaning out the tour van \\
Check and double check \\
Nothing left inside now \\
Nothing left to do \\
Empty out the empties \\
Half this stuff belongs to you \\
When you load down something heavy \\
You've gotta watch your back \\
So you walk sideways

Sideways \\
Sideways

[^pattersondeath]:
    [Roger Patterson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Patterson) was an
    influential bass player for the death metal band Atheist. He was killed in
    a tour bus crash in Louisiana on February 12, 1991.

## Thank You Mario but Our Princess Is in Another Castle [^mariojohn] [^mario] ## {#mario}

I waited here all by myself \\
The room was dark and it smelled like sulfur \\
I heard the screams from way down in the darkness \\
Felt pretty sure my life was over

I kept my hat on just for luck \\
Sang simple tunes the whole night through \\
I wondered if I'd wake to find myself in flames \\
As I waited here for you

Yeah when you came in \\
I could breathe again

I saw some guys dressed up like sorcerers \\
Blue robes that float above the ground [^magikoopa] \\
They came and went and I was frightened for my life \\
I tried not to make a sound

Just when my solitude was closing in \\
I heard a howl like screeching tires \\
And I told you the one thing I know how to say \\
Through the bright ringing drone of eight-bit choirs

Yeah when you came in \\
I could breathe again

[^mariojohn]:
    John's relationship to this song has been told many times. For example,
    see the banter at the Swedish-American Hall, San Francisco, June 27, 2012,
    which has a particularly brilliant version of this story.

    This song in some ways is related to [Enoch 18:14](tlotwtc.html#enoch),
    being the other Mountain Goats song known to be written from a video game
    line, and which also is told with great emotion despite its source.

[^mario]:
    This title is a direct quote from [Super Mario
    Bros.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros) When Mario, the
    protagonist, defeats a decoy of Bowser, the antagonist, at the end of
    World 1--4, he believes that he has completed his mission of finding
    Princess Peach but instead discovers Toad, who tells him, "Thank you
    Mario! But our Princess is in another castle!" This occurs at the end of
    every castle in the game until Mario finally defeats the real Bowser at
    the end of World 8--4.

[^magikoopa]:
    This seems to best describe
    [Magikoopas](http://www.mariowiki.com/Magikoopa), a magic-wielding version
    of the turtle-like Koopas who are a major enemy in Super Mario Bros.
    However, these do not appear in a Super Mario game until Super Mario
    World, which was released in 1990.
