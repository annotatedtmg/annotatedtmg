Ye-dina gṛhe, bhajana dekhi, gṛhete goloka bhāya. [^saranagati] \\
– BhaktivinoSri Chaitanya Saraswat Mathda Ṭhākura [^thakura]

Let me break with tradition and tell you right off how those words would sound
in the mother tongue. They're from a song in Hindi, and their meaning is: "One
day while performing devotional practices, I saw my house transformed into
Goloka Vrndavana, the spiritual world." What you hold in your hands is the
first in a series of three volumes which will collect the songs from various
cassettes, compilations, and singles, and which will endeavor by various means
to effect a similar transformation. From the outset I'd like to warn any
purists among you that neither *The Hound Chronicles* nor *Hot Garden Stomp*
will be included here, since those two will appear together on a single CD at
a later date. The only party still absent once I finish cleaning house will be
*Taboo VI: The Homecoming*, the existence of which I do not deny, but which I
am in no hurry to reexpose to the harsh light of the sun.

In collecting these songs, there seemed to me two general approaches possible.
The first was to put everything together in chronological order, which
possibility to me was completely intolerable. The second possibility, and the
one I've opted for, was to regard the material as though it'd just been found
among a bunch of tapes in an airtight container buried in the snow, and to
approach the task of piecing them together into coherent sequence with the
cruel hand of a propagandist. Needless to say, I can only remain faithful to
such an approach for a while before my vanity gets in the way. Ever since
agreeing to these reissues, I've been of two minds about what I should say
about the songs themselves. I wish that they were unified by a single theme,
some bone on which I'd been disconsolately gnawing without a break over the
past six or seven years, but of course they're not; had I that sort of unity
of vision, I suspect I'd be writing philosophical treatises instead of
dreaming up the circumstances in which these bitter little dramatic monologues
take place. If there is in fact any thread that can be traced through all
these songs, it's the voice of Qoheleth insisting that all is vanity;
[^qoheleth] the narrators of these songs seem often to give near-apocalyptic
weight to their petty grievances, and I am quite sure that some of them would
gladly trade the fate of the world for a few hours of relative happiness.
Ideally I would have placed these records in the tiny music libraries of
50-watt radio stations on the outskirts of Huntsville, Alabama, [^huntsville]
or Blind River, Ontario, [^blindriver] where the sole proprietors of such
stations would regard them with an uneasy respect that was always just one
step away from deep mistrust.

If, however, such stations and their proprietors do in fact exist --- I can't
bring myself to let go of the hope that they do --- they are not the audience
that has graciously adopted my songs as their own. To this audience I owe a
debt of gratitude greater than I would have dared to imagine on the day that I
bought a 3/4-sized guitar from a strange little store in Norwalk, California.
On that day I began transforming my house into something other than what it
was, and you all have been generous enough to look at the same house and give
me the benefit of the doubt. The following notes, though riddled with the lies
and half-truths which have become something of a trademark with me, offer a
few differing perspectives of that house. Here's hoping that whoever lives
there now has figured out how to turn down the radiator.

--- John Darnielle, Iowa, March 1998

CALIFORNIAN BY ACCIDENT.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAN BY THE GRACE OF GOD. [^southern]

The man on the front and the soybean sprig on the CD were drawn by Lalitree. A
thousand people to thank, but let's limit it to these: Dennis Callaci, Tim
Adams, Russell Hill, Jod, Simon Joyner, Chris Deden, Tim Alborn. The Bright
Mountain Choir: Rachel Ware, Roseanne Lindley, Sarah Coleman, and Amy Piatt.
Giana Bernardini. The aforementioned Lalitree. Special thanks to Classix
Nouveaux, [^classix] wherever you are. Anybody here think that Classix
Nouveaux will ever hear about this? Yeah, me neither, but it can't hurt.

*Fig. 1* Recent "fad" sources of protein such as stray radio waves or
test-weapon satellite broadcasts from unverifiable sources are often painful
and ineffective.

[^protein]:
    This phrase is the subtitle of a reprint for William Shurtleff and Akiko
    Aoyagi's cookbook, The Book of Tofu, now reprinted many times. It's not
    clear to me that the first edition used the subtitle, so I am referencing
    the oldest copy that I can verify had it.

[^songselsewhere]:
    A good deal of the liner notes are explanatory comments on individual
    songs or groups of songs. These are footnoted with the songs rather than
    being transcribed here.

[^saranagati]:
    A quote from one of Bhaktivinoda Thakura's book of devotional songs,
    Saranagati, printed in 1893 and describing the process of surrendering to
    Krishna. Translated, this reads, "On days when I see devotional service
    going on within my home, I feel that Goloka has manifested there."

    [Goloka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goloka) is the home of Krishna.

[^qoheleth]:
    Qoheleth is the name of the author of
    [Ecclesiastes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes) in the Old
    Testament, itself a translation into Latin from his name in Greek, which
    means Gatherer. The work is of anonymous origin, most likely written in
    the third century BC. In the book, he describes the vanity of trying to
    find meaning in our lives, encouraging people to enjoy what they have, do
    good, and obey God even in the absence of comprehension.

[^huntsville]:
    [Huntsville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville,_Alabama) is a
    medium-sized city in northern Alabama as described.

[^blindriver]:
    [Blind River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_River,_Ontario) is a
    small town on Lake Huron on the southern border of Ontario, Canada.

[^southern]:
    A parody of the slogan of anonymous origin, "American by birth, Southern
    by the grace of God".

[^classix]:
    [Classix Nouveaux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classix_Nouveaux) were an
    English pop band in the 1980s.

## Hand Ball [^handballjohn] [^salvation] [^handball] ## {#handball}

I am the dry meat that fills the mouth \\
I am the fire that burns without wood \\
I am Evil Forest \\
I kill a man on the day that his life seems sweetest to him [^thingsfallapart]

I did not come to play handball

[^salvation]:
    Both [Handball](#handball) and [Alpha Omega](#omega) were originally
    released on the *Our Salvation Is In Hand* compilation. The compilation
    was released by [Theme Park
    Records](http://www.underwaternow.com/ihearstrangemusic/themepark.htm) in
    the UK but contained a lot of Inland Empire tape musicians.

[^handballjohn]:
    "You'll get nothing from me, do you hear? Nothing! Anything I know about
    this odd little song will go with me to the grave." --- Protein Source of
    the Future... NOW! liner notes

    A truly phenomenal version of this is on the WNUR session, March 8, 2002,
    and John tells the story about it at Zoop II, Farm Sanctuary, New York,
    June 14, 2009, but you'll have to listen to it for yourself.

[^handball]:
    [Handball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball) is the name of several
    sports, most notably a competitive Olympic sport in which two teams
    attempt to throw a ball into their opponent's goal. Handball can also
    refer to [American
    handball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_handball), in which two
    players bounce a ball off of a wall in such a way that their competitor
    cannot strike it back, or [four
    square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_square), a playground
    children's game. None of these games are discussed in Things Fall Apart.

[^thingsfallapart]:
    These lines, like those of many songs on [Yam, the King of
    Crops](yam.html), are taken directly from Nigerian author Chinua Achebe's
    seminal work of African literature, [Things Fall
    Apart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_Fall_Apart). During an
    *egwugwu* ceremony, in which spirits filled the bodies of the clan leaders
    while trying to rule on a conflict, the head of the *egwugwu*, Evil
    Forest, speaks (p. 93):

    "We have heard both sides of this case," said Evil Forest. "Our duty is
    not to blame this man or to praise that, but to settle the dispute." He
    turned to Uzowulu's group and allowed a short pause.

    "Uzowulu's body, I salute you," he said.

    "Our father, my hand has touched the ground," replied Uzowulu, touching
    the earth.

    "Uzowulu's body, do you know me?"

    "How can I know you, father? You are beyond our knowledge," Uzowulu
    replied.

    "I am Evil Forest. I kill a man on the day that his life seems sweetest to
    him."

    "That is true," replied Uzowulu.

    "Go to your in-laws with a pot of wine and beg your wife to return to you.
    It is not bravery when a man fights with a woman." He turned to Odukwe,
    and allowed a brief pause.

    "Odukwe's body, I greet you," he said.

    "My hand is on the ground," replied Odukwe.

    "Do you know me?"

    "No man can know you," replied Odukwe.

    "I am Evil Forest, I am Dry-meat-that-fills-the-mouth, I am
    Fire-that-burns-without-faggots. If your in-law brings wine to you, let
    your sister go with him. I salute you." He pulled his staff from the hard
    earth and thrust it back.

## The Window Song [^windowjohn] [^pawnshop] ## {#window}

A knocking sound, it woke me up \\
But my legs were feeling weak \\
I stared up at the ceiling and I saw you at the window \\
But my mouth wouldn't let me speak

I know you, you're the one \\
I've spent three seasons trying \\
To pretend that I never knew

Something pulled me off the bed \\
And the same thing moved the muscles in my legs \\
I moved toward your voice and my body got so light \\
I could have walked on eggs right then and not broken a one of them

I know you, you're the one \\
I've spent three seasons trying \\
To pretend that I never knew

I know you, you're the one \\
I've spent three seasons trying \\
To pretend that I never knew

I know you, you're the one \\
I've spent three seasons trying \\
To pretend that I never knew

I know you, you're the one \\
I've spent three seasons trying \\
To pretend that I never knew

*"Shake!"*

## Duke Ellington [^ellingtonjohn] [^ellingtonseries] [^secret] [^ellington] ## {#ellington}

Light hit the rings \\
Glimmering on his fingers \\
The light came down

And his hands hit the keys \\
It utterly wasted me \\
In Sweden

Horns punched the air \\
The aftermath fell around everywhere

I saw the spotlight land on his rings \\
And I'd had just about enough of losing things \\
In Sweden \\
In 1962 \\
Quite some distance from you

[^ellingtonjohn]:
    "One of two pieces written for the song-cycle Sweden and intentionally
    left off of the album. Standing all by itself, this song took on, for me,
    an almost mystical sadness. Then again, I'm always pretty sentimental
    where the names of dead jazz musicians are involved."

[^ellingtonseries]:

[^ellington]:
    [Duke Ellington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Ellington) was a
    celebrated jazz bandleader, composer, and pianist in the early to mid 20th
    century. I'm not aware of any connection to him in Sweden; by 1962 he was
    near the end of his life but still leading his orchestra, dying in 1974.

## Alpha Omega [^omegajohn] [^omegaseries] [^salvation] ## {#omega}

On the morning you went away \\
The air was humid and the sky was gray \\
I had boiled peanuts for breakfast from Cairo, Georgia [^cairo]

The air was wet, my face was wetter \\
The pink flowers along the western window made me feel better \\
I turned the air conditioner on \\
Found the note on scented stationary, you were long gone \\
I had boiled peanuts for breakfast from Cairo, Georgia

I popped the top off the aluminum can \\
Let the brine slide down my fingers, man \\
It was warm, it was warm on my skin \\
But I felt the cold blast moving on in \\
I had boiled peanuts for breakfast from Cairo, Georgia

[^omegajohn]:
    Originally intended to be the last song written of the Alpha series, until
    the writing of Tallahassee. This song remains the end of the Alpha
    couple's story as hinted at by the use of omega, the last letter in the
    Greek alphabet. As pointed out by [Wild
    Creature](http://www.mountain-goats.com/forums/read.php?3,46561,46769#msg-46769),
    potentially also referring to [Omega,
    Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega,_Georgia), a small town only
    50 miles from Cairo. In the liner notes, John writes:

    The series known as "Songs from Alpha Privitive" concludes here, having
    begun at a ski lodge some years earlier. Some deaths just will not be
    cheated no matter how good you get.

    This is confirmed at Capitol Theater, Olympia, Yo-Yo-a-Go-Go Festival,
    July 16, 1997; WFMU session, October 19, 2000; VPRO session, Amstel
    Festival, December 7, 2002; KEXP session, August 21, 2006.

[^omegaseries]:
    Alpha Omega is part of the [Alpha couple series](series.html#alpha).

[^cairo]:
    [Cairo, Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo,_Georgia), pronounced
    KAY-ro, is a town in southern Georgia near the Tallahassee border.
