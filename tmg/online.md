{: .release-art .top .horiz}

With enough frequency that these songs deserve their own category, John
sometimes offers music through the [Mountain Goats forums][forums],
[Twitter][], [William Caxton Fan Club][tumblr], and other similar locations.
Songs for whom this was the primary vehicle of release and which were not
released as part of a collection are found here and listed chronologically;
songs released in collections can be found at their respective pages, namely,
[Seven for Australia][7aus], [Three for Mike G][3mike], and [Hospicio de
Huerfanos][hospicio].

Multiple demos have been released online, namely, Daniel 12:8 (third),
[Michael Myers Resplendent](heretic.html#myers), [No
Children](sunset.html#nochildren), [Surrounded](mcb.html#surrounded), and
[Andrew Eldritch Is Moving Back to Leeds](goths.html#eldritch). Additionally,
the demo for [Emerging](mcb.html#emerging) appeared online without known
origin (please [email me](../about.html#contact) if you know). Similarly,
several live tracks have been given out online, including Down to the Ark, The
Smokey Life (a Leonard Cohen cover), and others. Information about these
tracks are in the pages dedicated to their corresponding releases or on the
unreleased page. This page is just for tracks which have studio, boombox, or
other definitive recordings released online. The preorder demos from Heretic
Pride, along with the online demo for Michael Myers Resplendent, are often
referred to collectively as Songs for Vamsidasa Babaji, due to their album
tags. This is discussed further within [Heretic
Pride](heretic.html#fn:vamsidasa).

Often these have been offered with a request that the downloader contribute to
a charity. This website similarly requests that if you obtain a copy of these
songs, or enjoy these annotations, donate. They're good causes.

## All Devils Here Now [^devilsjohn] ## {#devils}

On humid evenings you have heard \\
Your neighbors making noises that you \\
Wonder for a while about and then \\
Put off investigating \\
Shrieks and squeals and high-pitched whines \\
And we \\
We are your neighbors

In hazy afternoons you've watched your \\
Neighbors come and go and maybe \\
Stay away a day or two \\
And then return appearing worse for wear \\
Scratched up and hollow-eyed \\
You tried \\
Your best to ignore us

You see us at the grocery store \\
You wonder what we're shopping for \\
We lean against the Thermador [^thermador] \\
Eyes fixed firmly on the floor \\
Pomona's [^pomona] big as all outdoors \\
And we \\
We are your neighbors

[^devilsjohn]:
    Released by John on Twitter on the occasion of reaching 40,000 followers:

    "1/3 OK well I hit 40 thousand followers a few weeks back but I was on
    tour & busy with stuff so this had to wait

    "2/3 this is from a while back: it shares psychic & geographic space with
    all the other stuff I was writing about in 2002 & 2003

    "3/3 so yeah, here's an old demo. the bugs you hear are actual Iowa bugs
    outside the window where I was recording.Enjoy!

    My best guess is that this song falls into similar cycles as those in We
    Shall All Be Healed, however, without more information, I hesistate to
    call it an outtake.

    John encoded the metadata to read "Estimated Quantity of Devils" for the
    album and identified the genre as "Spirituality".

    Pitzer, one member of the consortium.

## The Big Unit [^bigunitjohn] [^bigunit] ## {#bigunit}

I sunk all of my money into Swiss gold [^swissbanking] \\
And I watched the market slide \\
And I stood on the edge of the Pacific and watched the \\
Hypodermic needles coming in with the tide \\
There are two guys just outside of Chicago \\
Looking for me tonight \\
But Randy Johnson throws a baseball 97 miles an hour [^bigunit] \\
And I'm gonna be all right

I had a fully loaded junk bond portfolio [^junkbond] that \\
Didn't work out like it was supposed to \\
There's a mountain of money in the bond market \\
That I can't seem to get close to \\
I've been headed down the road to ruin \\
The end is nowhere in sight \\
But Randy Johnson throws a baseball 97 miles an hour \\
And I'm gonna be all right

[^bigunitjohn]:
    Released by John to support [p:ear](http://pearmentor.org), a
    Portland-based organization dedicated to providing art education to
    homeless youth. John asked for a donation to download the song; please
    donate to p:ear before downloading this song. As he posted on the forums
    (and there is a longer story):

    well, here's the deal. even though I got all kinds of news coming up and
    should probably focus on that, I got an entreaty today from p:ear, and it
    moved me in my spirit. some of you know that when I lived in portland I
    hung with the street kids. now there is an organization that helps out the
    kids who were my people back then & who will always be my people in my
    heart. I have more love for this organization than I can even tell you.

    they need to raise a bunch of money & I would like you to give them some.
    I am here linking one old song. I am requesting that everybody who grabs
    it give p:ear some money. five bucks, ten bucks, twenty bucks, whatever.
    as much as you can. I had a much bigger post here but now it's smaller!
    long story. anyway.

## Bride [^bridejohn] [^brideseries] [^frankenstein] ## {#bride}

*"One, two, three, and."*

Designed for one another \\
We lie tied our slabs \\
While the same electricity that gave us life \\
Crackles through the lab

And I am too dumb \\
To tell you how I feel \\
Who will know, who will tell anyone \\
That what we had was real

We belong dead [^belongdead] \\
We belong dead

So I try and try to focus \\
To say what I want to say \\
But it's such hard work \\
And we don't have all day

Our efforts won't add up \\
To any great amount \\
Get one chance to make your gesture down here \\
I want to make mine count

We belong dead \\
We belong dead \\
We belong dead \\
We belong dead

[^bridejohn]:
    John describes this as being an outtake from The Life of the World to
    Come, although it shares much more thematically with All Eternals Deck. He
    offered it on the forums because he enjoyed it and wanted it to be heard:

    Yeah all right you guys here is the deal. Next album is nearly done but I
    wrote this one song today that won't really fit on it - why that's so will
    be clear when the next album comes out. (Sometime in the fall, we think.)
    Thought it was a pretty decent song, a really minor half-done demo but I
    really like the overall feeling, so I figured I'd just let you have it.
    It's about the Bride of Frankenstein. If you haven't seen it, don't be
    boring and look it up on Wikipedia or whatever, just get it & see it, it's
    one of the all-timers anyway and you will love it.

    New people are advised that acceptance of free stuff from me means you
    swear, to God & on your family and/or your best friend's health & safety,
    not to later on be the sort of insufferable blowhard who runs around
    insisting that the demos that didn't make the album were better than the
    songs that did. Because: no, they weren't. Saying stuff like that seems to
    be a good way to score scene points, but if you accept this song, you
    sacrifice your claim to those particular type of scene points. These
    conditions apply whether you grab the file from this board or wherever
    else so don't even try to duck me, because you cannot duck me, the ring
    only has four corners and I will find you in one of them.

    "This --- I always liked this song, so I put it on the internet once and
    then forgot about it. It's about the Bride of Frankenstein." --- Kaufman
    Center Ecstatic Music Fest, New York, March 24, 2012

[^brideseries]:
    Bride is part of the [informal series of outtakes](series.html#outtakes).

[^frankenstein]:
    [Bride of
    Frankenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bride_of_Frankenstein) is the
    1935 sequel to the 1931 film adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel
    Frankenstein. In the film, Henry Frankenstein attempts to improve upon his
    creation, making a second monster to be a partner to the first. Upon
    ressurection, the Bride rejects the Monster. Devastated, the Monster
    orders Frankenstein to leave, killing himself, the Bride, Dr.  Pretorius,
    and destroying the laboratory once they flee.

[^belongdead]:
    These are the Monster's exact words to Frankenstein before killing himself
    and the Bride by destroying the laboratory.

## Counting Song for Bitter Children [^countingjohn] ## {#counting}

*"Mmkay, let's try this."*

One, two \\

One, two, two and a half \\
Stick around here, don't make me laugh \\
Two and half, three, four point five \\
A new day's dawning and my hour's arrived

One, two \\

    Released on the forums during a long, excited discussion about the best
    Mountain Goats lines. Stingray recalled the opening lines from the
    fragment played on the 1998 Blackwatch Pub bootleg and a discussion about
    the song ensued. John jumped in, trying to remember the rest of the song,
    and ended up recording the song again and posting the track:

    ok this was such an interesting exercise in experimenting with
    completely-vanished memory that I went ahead and spent twenty
    hard-concentrating minutes trying to remember the song (it doesn't hurt
    that it contains its own mnemonics) and I got all the lines - the only one
    I'm not entirley confident about are the last two numbers sung, I feel
    like they were maybe "five/nine" or something but I can't find anything
    that quite rings right. The rest of them I'm quite certain are the lyrics
    to this lost song which when I first wrote it I was gonna put as the lead
    song on a 7" but I just never got around to it. So anyway here is
    "Counting Song for Bitter Children"

    Song is circa '94 I think. Maybe earlier. This recording is circa half an
    hour ago.

    when the link expires it's somebody else's job to reup it not mine, I
    hereby wash my hands of it

## For the Krishnacore Bands [^krishnacorerelease] [^krishnacorejohn] [^krishnacoreseries] [^krishnacore] ## {#krishnacore}

*"This is, uh, For the Krishnacore Bands. One, two, three, and."*

You stuck by the scene, but did the scene stick by you \\
In a few cases, yes \\
Maybe in one or two

But you routinely got called out \\
By Maximum Rocknroll [^maximum] \\
And you weren't ever gonna fit in \\
At the Fireside Bowl [^fireside]

And back in the day, punks \\
Practically declaring war \\
As if there were anything \\
More orthodox than hardcore [^hardcore] \\
As if there were anything more orthodox than hardcore

You stuck to your guns when you were running out of ammo \\
Even on packaged tours [^packaged] \\
Supporting metalcore [^metalcore] guys in camo

You find more common threads than you'd expect to in these places \\
Always see the holy name \\
Light up a few new faces

And back in the day, punks \\
Still with plenty of shit to say \\
Covertly cashing in \\
On dead stock of your early demos on eBay

But where were they on the night you first shaved your head \\
Drinking beer in a field someplace with all creation overhead \\
And where were they when the locals were ganging up on you \\
Lining up to join some nearly identical crew

You stuck it out for several years or maybe you moved on \\
Nobody's really sure \\
Where Jayadvaita's [^jayadvaita] gone

Some say he's a stoner now \\
Creeper Dave swears that's true [^creeper] \\
But when you point one finger at the Krishna punks \\
I've got two fingers up for you [^fingers]

And back in the day, punks \\
Singing the same old song \\
About the kids who brought the banquet to the matinee \\
But preached just a little too long \\
Yeah, they preached just a little too long

[^krishnacorejohn]:
    John edited the song's metadata to have the genre "Hardcore" and be from
    the album "new songs 2017"; surprisingly straightforward for an online
    Mountain Goats release. The .m4a file contained cover art for the song,
    which was a PNG image of the Krishnacore band
    [Shelter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelter_(band)). Shelter, founded
    in 1989 by frontman Ray Cappo (previously of straight edge punk band Youth
    of Today), is widely considered to be the genre's pre-eminent band. As of
    September 14, 2017, the image used as the cover art is the band's profile
    photo on their [MySpace page](https://myspace.com/eternalshelter). I'm not
    sure where the photo originates --- if you know, please [email
    me](../about.html#contact)!

[^krishnacoreseries]:
    For the Krishnacore Bands is part of the [Song for ...
    series](series.html#songfor).

[^krishnacore]:
    [Krishnacore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnacore) is a subgenre of
    hardcore punk which expounds on the [Hare
    Krishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_for_Krishna_Consciousness)
    tradition. Formally under the International Society for Krishna
    Consciousness, Hare Krishna practitioners form the largest portion of
    Gaudiya Vaishnava Hinduism. Devotees practice bhakti yoga dedicated to
    Krishna, and abstain from eating meat or eggs, non-procreative sex,
    intoxicants, and gambling. They are known for chanting the Maha Mantra:

    > Hare Krishna Hare Krishna \\
    > Krishna Krishna Hare Hare \\
    > Hare Rama Hare Rama \\
    > Rama Rama Hare Hare

    from which their colloquial name arises, and for publicly preaching, often
    with shaved heads and saffron robes.

    Krishnacore itself is related to the non-religious [straight
    edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_edge) punk movement. Straight
    edge punks abstain from alcohol, drugs, promiscuous sex, and are generally
    vegan or vegetarian. The band
    [Shelter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelter_(band)) is often
    considered to have founded the genre when they began playing hardcore punk
    infused with Krishna consciousness in 1989. Frontman and founder Ray Cappo
    along with other members became renunciant monks, living on a Hare Krishna
    farm. Other Krishnacore bands include the
    [Cro-Mags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cro-Mags), [Fed
    Up!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_Up!), and
    [108](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/108_(band)). The term *Krishnacore*
    was applied retrospectively, with few bands referring to themselves in
    that manner.

[^maximum]:
    [Maximum Rocknroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximumrocknroll) is a
    prominent San Francisco punk rock zine continuously in press since 1982.
    Throughout its life, it has promoted the DIY punk culture, hardcore punk,
    and covers politics from an anti-authoritarian punk perspective,
    frequently aligning with anarchism. The zine originated from a punk radio
    show which aired under the same name on KPFA in Berkeley in the 1970s. It
    remains volunteer-run and independent.

    The zine is known for taking hard lines on controversial issues, and in
    its December 1989 issue featured an interview with Shelter's Ray Cappo
    alongside an article titled *Inside Ray Cappo and the Krishnas* attacking
    Shelter and other bands with Hare Krishna influence. Their criticism
    included a rejection of their conservative anti-homosexuality and
    anti-abortion positions. Later zines over the years continued their
    disdain for the movement. During that time period, Maximum Rocknroll would
    not accept advertisements from Equal Vision Records, the label started by
    Cappo.

[^fireside]:
    The [Fireside Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fireside_Bowl) is a
    live music venue and bowling alley in the Logan Square neighborhood of
    Chicago. Through the early 2000s, the Fireside was a major part of the
    underground punk scene. A series of live albums titled *Live at the
    Fireside Bowl* have been released by numerous punk bands, including the
    Casualties, Against All Authority, Anti-Flag, and others.

[^hardcore]:
    [Hardcore punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk) is a subgenre
    of punk dating to the original 1970s origin of punk music, featuring fast,
    aggressive music frequently with political content. The genre's aesthetics
    generally include independent, non-commercial, DIY releases,
    anti-authoritarianism, and radically left-wing or anarchist politics.

[^packaged]:
    A [package tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_tour) is a
    pre-planned, cookie-cutter tour bought from a tour guide, rather than
    being created by the traveler.

[^metalcore]:
    [Metalcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalcore) is a musical genre
    fusing heavy metal and hardcore punk. The genre typically includes heavy
    guitarlines, slow, aggressive breakdowns, death growls, double bass
    drumming, and lyrics focusing on personal pain.

[^jayadvaita]:
    [Jayadvaita Swami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayadvaita_Swami) is a
    sannyasa and significant member of the International Society for Krishna
    Consciousness and one of the direct students of AC Bhaktivedanta Swami

    I've done my best to figure out if this references a particular person and
    haven't found one. If you know, please [let me
    know](../about.html#contact)!

[^fingers]:
    One finger is clearly a reference to [the middle
    finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_finger), the obscene hand
    gesture. Two fingers could mean several things. One is the [sign of the
    horns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_of_the_horns), often used in
    heavy metal, and another is the [V
    sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_sign), either forwards as a sign for
    peace or backwards as the two-fingered salute, an obscene hand gesture in
    Europe. A specific hand sign related to the Hare Krishnas is the
    mrigashirsha hasta gesture, looking similar to a shaka sign with the
    index, middle, and ring fingers partially extended. This gesture is
    related to Krishna's use of the flute. Finally, Hare Krishnas chant with
    beads between their thumb and middle finger, leaving the index and little
    fingers extended. I'm not sure which if any of these is being referenced.

    Released on the forums after John recorded it without finding an album to

    "This is another song about child abuse." --- Zoop II, Farm Sanctuary, New
    York, June 13, 2009

    "This is a song about how you cope with what you got to cope with when
    you're 16 years old and you're not an abuse survivor yet because you're in
    the middle of surviving it." --- Rock for Roe, Pinhook, Durham, January
    20, 2013

    "This is one of \[two songs that never got released\]. And the reason we
    didn't release it is like, it's sort of a supplement to the Sunset Tree,
    and I felt after we'd done the Sunset Tree that it would be a little
    unseemly to keep writing about that period in my life, because I thought I
    had done that, and I think that songwriters who keep milking the same
    region are lazy fucks, and that you have to move on, you have to grow.  I
    know that your audience will tell you you were better when you were doing
    the same thing over and over, but that's not true and besides that, how
    will you sleep with yourself... So I did this one song, and then I bade
    goodbye to those years." --- American Theater Company, Chicago, May 16,
    2010

    "This was the one that sort of opened up stuff for the Sunset Tree for
    me. It refers to a drug store called TG&Y. This is a true story." ---
    Letters to Santa, Chicago, December 7, 2011

    Listen also to the amazing banter from the December 16, 2011 Troubadour
    show for a story about John's love for TG&Y and the graffiti behind the
    Claremont store.

[^huffing]:
    A wide variety of household compounds can be [dangerously
    inhaled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intoxicative_inhalant) to produce a
    high, called "huffing". Huffing solvents of any kind, including paint, is
    highly risky. The high is produced by inhaling the fumes after spraying
    the aerosol and paint into a bag.

[^tgny]:
    [TG&Y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TG%26Y) was a dollar store chain
    throughout the United States named for its founders, Tomlinson, Gosselin,
    and Young. The last TG&Y closed its doors in 2001.

[^indianhill]:
    Given the Sunset Tree context, I think this most likely refers to Indian
    Hill Boulevard, a major road through Claremont and Pomona. Indian Hill
    also appears in [Hye Kye](mike.html#hyekye). John sings this line as
    "Indian Hill Boulevard" on occasion, confirming this hypothesis (see for
    example the American Theater Company, Chicago, May 16, 2010 show).

[^folgers]:
    [Folgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folgers) is an American brand of
    cheap coffee.

[^barnard]:
    Sometimes sung with the alternate couplet, "Called my friend at Barnard /
    Two thousand miles away" (see for example at Zoop II, Farm Sanctuary, June
    13, 2009, or at the American Theater Company in Chicago, May 16, 2010).
    [Barnard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard_College) is a private
    women's university associated with Columbia in Manhattan, making these
    lyrics consistent with the original.

[^rhoads]:
    As John [explains above](#fn:backtocaliforniajohn), Going Back to
    California is about the death of [Randy
    Rhoads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Rhoads), the guitarist for
    Ozzy Osbourne. He died in 1982 in Leesburg, Florida, between shows in
    Knoxville and Orlando during the Diary of a Madman Tour. Their tour bus
    driver, Andrew Aycock, was also a private pilot. On the drive,
    they stopped at an airstrip, and he took Rhoads and makeup artist Rachel
    Youngblood flying. They did not have permission to fly the plane, and
    Aycock was posthumously found to have been high on cocaine. On their third
    low pass, Aycock went to buzz the bus, but clipped it instead, killing
    Aycock, Rhoades, and Youngblood. Their bodies were ejected from the
    burning plane, and they were discovered by Osbourne and the other sleeping
    band members, family, and friends, damaged beyond ability to identify them.

[^leesburg]:
    [Leesburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leesburg,_Florida) is a small
    city in central Florida.

[^california]:
    Rhoads was born in Santa Monica, southern California, and would be buried
    shortly after his death in San Bernardino, California. After his death,
    the band returned to Los Angeles for a week and a half to recuperate, find
    a new guitarist to continue the tour, and attend the memorials for Rhoades
    and Youngblood.

[^drinking]:
    As [Ozzy Osbourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzy_Osbourne) was
    sleeping in the bus during the plane crash, his last words with Rhoads
    were on the drive as Rhoads admonished him for his heavy drinking after
    Ozzy made fun of him for wanting to go to college. The last thing Rhoads
    said to Osbourne was "You'll kill yourself, y'know? One of these days."

    Given the first person statement here, this song is clearly from the
    perspective of Osbourne.

[^twoweeks]:
    The band took only a very short reprieve after Rhoads' death. Bassist Rudy
    Sarzo recollects only taking ten days off before continuing the tour, at
    least partially as a way to keep everyone --- and especially Ozzy, who was
    hit very hard by Rhoads' death --- occupied so they wouldn't get even more
    deeply depressed.

## Power in a Union [^powerjohn] [^powerseries] [^powercover] ## {#power}

There is power in a factory \\
There is power in the land \\
There is power in the hand of the worker \\
But it all amounts to nothing \\
If together we don't stand \\
Though there is power in a union

Now the lessons of the past \\
Were all learned with workers' blood \\
The mistakes of the bosses we must pay for \\
From the cities and the farmlands \\
To the factories full of mud \\
War has always been the bosses' way, sir

The union forever \\
Defending our rights \\
Down with the black leg \\
All workers unite \\
With our brothers and our sisters \\
From many far-off lands \\
Oh, there is power in a union

Now I long for the morning \\
When they all realize \\
Brutality and unjust laws cannot defeat us \\
But who'll defend the worker \\
Who cannot organize \\
When the bosses send their lackeys, sir, to cheat us

Money speaks for money \\
The devil for his own \\
Who'll come to speak for \\
The skin and the bone \\
What a comfort to the widow and a light to the child \\
Oh, there is power in a union

The union forever \\
Defending our rights \\
Down with the black leg \\
All workers unite \\
With our brothers and our sisters \\
Together we all stand \\
Oh, there is power in a union

    "Enjoy what will be the most comprehensive recall effort in the history of

    tunes tomorrow. Who among us doesn't owe our teachers big?

## Short Song for Justin Bieber and His Paparazzi [^bieberjohn] [^bieberseries] ## {#bieber}

Now on the one hand, it's hard to feel sorry for the very rich \\
You could record an album of Mountain Goats covers and torpedo your career overnight \\
You chose this life

But on the other hand, even a rich guy needs some space \\
And should be able to get to his car without people all up in his face \\
And getting on his case

You don't have to leave Justin alone \\
You don't have to leave Justin alone \\
But don't be an asshole

Are there bigger problems in the world, yes \\

## Sign of the Crow 2 [^crowjohn] [^crowseries] [^berthepetit] ## {#crow}

These roses are the pleasures of the flesh \\
These ones here they are the pleasures of the spirit \\
And tucked behind a pornographic picture in a frame \\
The troops found the pierced heart and they all gathered near it [^berthepetit]

And the dust clouds bloomed in the dark \\
And the face gazed up from the frame \\
Room full of French troops in a Franciscan abbey [^abbey] \\
History does not recall their names

Of the several things that you have to do today \\
You're gonna regret one \\
This generation asks for a sign \\
It isn't gonna get one [^matthewmark]

Well, Berthe [^berthepetit] took the pictures to the priest \\
The priest fell on his face upon the floor \\
And the story lived on for a decade or two \\
But no one really knows it anymore

But the Blessed Heart is seen in the airbrush \\
And the Blessed Heart is beating on the wind \\
And the bodies of the faithful stacked by dozens by the roadsides \\
Stripped and scourged and skinned

Of the several things that you have to do today \\
You're gonna regret one \\
This generation asks for a sign \\
It isn't gonna get one

[^crowjohn]:
    Released as an apology to those who preordered Heretic Pride, which wasn't
    shipped on time due to a computer glitch. As discussed further
    [here](#fn:berthepetit), the song is about one of the myths surrounding
    [Berthe Petit][berthewiki], a Franciscan nun:

    To those of you who were kind enough to preorder the album but who didn't
    get it due to some sort of glitch thing about which I know everybody at
    4AD feels as "d'oh!" as I do -

    here for you is a song I wrote yesterday afternoon. As a demo it's not
    even done, there's a prepositional phrase I stumble over toward the end (I
    think I need an "in" instead of a "by" in the line that I flub) and it's
    pretty funny but on the whole I'm pretty fond of the jam and plus if I
    know my people you will enjoy the extra rawness.

    The subject of the song is the origin of [this
    image](http://www.7dolors.com/images/maryollignies.jpg), which is a rad
    story I will tell you more about someday but meanwhile there's plenty of
    info in the jam itself. [Here is the song, written and demo'd 20 February
    2008 in Anchorage, AK.](http://www.mediafire.com/?0sywnbydgzx) It's an AAC
    and somebody else is gonna have to do the mp3 conversion for people who
    don't use iTunes.

    It would be cool if people didn't immediately run off to other forums to
    share this, it's not really for every random schmoe on the planet but is a
    gift to the preordering people. Yes; that would cool. I don't have any
    illusions, I am just trying to make dudes who're already gonna do this
    feel a little guilty about it, because that is how us Catholics roll.

[^berthepetit]:
    [Berthe Petit][berthewiki] was a Franciscan nun who reported having
    multiple spiritual visions throughout her life. In one such story, Petit
    discovered an image of Mother Mary hidden behind a piece of pornography in
    her school. This image, known as Our Lady of Ollignies or The Sorrowful
    and Immaculate Heart of Mary, is the one John refers to in this song.

    Describing the cover photo of the 28th edition of The Secret of the
    Rosary, which features this image, the editors write:

    "The front cover of the Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary: This
    picture, somewhat mysterious in its origin, was discovered at the time of
    the 1918 armistice in the cellar of the boarding school where Berthe
    Petit, a humble Franciscan Tertiary, had been educated. After the troops
    had departed, one of the Bernardine nuns in putting things in order found
    a piece of cardboard on which was pasted a pornographic picture and she
    tore it off to consign it to flames. To her astonishment she found that it
    covered this beautiful representation of the Blessed Virgin! It seems to
    combine the art of both the Eastern and the Western Rites. The facial
    features resemble those of the well known Pieta. Prayer before this
    picture has brought signal favors." de Montfort, Saint Louis Mary (1995).

    A reference to the [Sign of
    Jonah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typology_(theology)#Example_of_Jonah).
    Jonah was swallowed by a great whale, in whose belly he lived for three
    days and three nights. Jesus referred to this as a sign for his
    resurrection, which similarly took three days and nights.

    "But sighing deeply in His spirit, He said, 'Why does this generation
    demand a sign? I assure you: No sign will be given to this generation!'"

    "But He answered them, 'An evil and adulterous generation demands a sign,
    but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For
    as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so
    the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three
    nights. The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this
    generation and condemn it, because they repented at Jonah's proclamation;
    and look --- something greater than Jonah is here!'"

But on Thursday night there's matches on TV \\
Get kicked out of the living room for watching \\

Keep watching with the lights out back in his room \\

I want to do right by my brother [^autism] \\
I want to do right by this feeling in my gut

Everybody's got \\
Their own spot \\
Find mine \\
In 64 point type atop the top line \\
Up on the top line

Head off to camp in Boston \\
Come up through the independence \\
Those who would stand between me and my final destination \\
Get torched inside the fire of my transcendence

California, Minnesota, Massachusetts \\
They can tell I'm coming up by the expression on my face \\
I'm gonna make a lot of money \\
Everyone I love is gonna have their own safe place

Everybody's got \\
Their own spot \\
Find mine \\
In 64 point type atop the top line \\

    is a WWE pay-per-view ladder match (where the prize is hung above the ring

    Thucydides II -- 58's album is tagged as "Temporary Hellenism", and the
    genre as "plaguecore".
    [Hellenism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_Greece) refers to
    the study of ancient Greece, spanning the classical period. Technically,
    this period is slightly later than the period described in this song,
    which occurs in the middle of 4th century BC.

[^thucydides]:
    [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) was a 5th century
    Greek general whose book, *History of the Peloponnesian War*, became a
    classic reference for the period. This song refers to several sections of
    the text which discuss the [Plague of
    Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Athens), a tremendous wave
    of sickness which originated in Ethiopia and spread, killing tens of
    thousands of people and leading to the cessation of Sparta's invasion due
    to fear of the disease.

    Book II, chapter 58, reads:

    "The same summer Agnon the son of Nicias and Cleopompus the son of
    Clinias, who were joint commanders with Pericles with that army which he
    had employed before, went presently and made war upon the Chalcideans of
    Thrace and against Potidaea which was yet besieged. Arriving, they
    presently applied engines and tried all means possible to take it, but
    neither the taking of the city nor anything else succeeded worthy so great
    preparation. For the sickness coming amongst them afflicted them mightily
    indeed and even devoured the army. And the Athenian soldiers which were
    there before and in health catched the sickness from those that came with
    Agnon. As for Phormio and his sixteen hundred, they were not now amongst
    the Chalcideans. And Agnon therefore came back with his fleet, having of
    four thousand men in less than forty days lost one thousand and fifty of
    the plague. But the soldiers that were there before stayed upon the place
    and continued the siege of Potidaea."

[^symptoms]:
    Among the symptoms reported by Thucydides were red skin, a deep fever
    resulting in an inability to tolerate even light clothing, and vomiting:

    "... they were taken first with an extreme ache in their heads, redness
    and inflammation of the eyes; and then inwardly, their throats and tongues
    grew presently bloody and their breath noisome and unsavoury. Upon this
    followed a sneezing and hoarseness, and not long after the pain, together
    with a mighty cough, came down into the breast. And when once it was
    settled in the stomach, it caused vomit; and with great torment came up
    all manner of bilious purgation that physicians ever named. Most of them
    had also the hickyexe which brought with it a strong convulsion, and in
    some ceased quickly but in others was long before it gave over. Their
    bodies outwardly to the touch were neither very hot nor pale but reddish,
    livid, and beflowered with little pimples and whelks, but so burned
    inwardly as not to endure any the lightest clothes or linen garment to be
    upon them nor anything but mere nakedness, but rather most willingly to
    have cast themselves into the cold water. And many of them that were not
    looked to, possessed with insatiate thirst, ran unto the wells, and to
    drink much or little was indifferent, being still from ease and power to
    sleep as far as ever. As long as the disease was at its height, their
    bodies wasted not but resisted the torment beyond all expectation;
    insomuch as the most of them either died of their inward burning in nine
    or seven days whilst they had yet strength, or, if they escaped that, then
    the disease falling down into their bellies and causing there great
    exulcerations and immoderate looseness, they died many of them afterwards
    through weakness. For the disease, which took first the head, began above
    and came down and passed through the whole body; and he that overcame the
    worst of it was yet marked with the loss of his extreme parts; for
    breaking out both at their privy members and at their fingers and toes,
    many with the loss of these escaped; there were also some that lost their
    eyes. And many that presently upon their recovery were taken with such an
    oblivion of all things whatsoever, as they neither knew themselves nor
    their acquaintance."

    Thucydides (1843). [*History of the Peloponnesian
    War*](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.49).

[^doctors]:
    Thucydides reports that physicians died more quickly than others due to
    their frequent encounters with the sick:

    "For at first neither were the physicians able to cure it through
    ignorance of what it was but died fastest themselves, as being the men
    that most approached the sick, nor any other art of man availed
    whatsoever."

    Thucydides (1843). [*History of the Peloponnesian
    War*](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.47).

[^god]:
    Thucydides describes both the futility of prayer and the loss of moral
    codes in response to the disease:

    [II.47](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.47):
    "All supplications to the gods and enquiries of oracles and whatsoever
    other means they used of that kind proved all unprofitable; insomuch as
    subdued with the greatness of the evil, they gave them all over."

    [II.53](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.53):
    "And the great licentiousness, which also in other kinds was used in the
    city, began at first from this disease. For that which a man before would
    dissemble and not acknowledge to be done for voluptuousness, he durst now
    do freely, seeing before his eyes such quick revolution, of the rich dying
    and men worth nothing inheriting their estates. Insomuch as they justified
    a speedy fruition of their goods even for their pleasure, as men that
    thought they held their lives but by the day. As for pains, no man was
    forward in any action of honour to take any because they thought it
    uncertain whether they should die or not before they achieved it. But what
    any man knew to be delightful and to be profitable to pleasure, that was
    made both profitable and honourable. Neither the fear of the gods nor laws
    of men awed any man, not the former because they concluded it was alike to
    worship or not worship from seeing that alike they all perished, nor the
    latter because no man expected that lives would last till he received
    punishment of his crimes by judgment. But they thought there was now over
    their heads some far greater judgment decreed against them before which
    fell, they thought to enjoy some little part of their lives."

[^sailors]:
    During the Plague, a hundred and fifty ships with several thousand men
    were loosed with the intent of razing Spartan cities.

    "Whilst they were yet in the plain and before they entered into the
    maritime country, he furnished a hundred galleys to go about Peloponnesus
    and, as soon as they were ready, put to sea. In these galleys he had four
    thousand men of arms, and in vessels then purposely first made to carry
    horses, three hundred horsemen. The Chians and Lesbians joined likewise
    with him with fifty galleys. This fleet of the Athenians, when it set
    forth, left the Peloponnesians still in Paralia; and coming before
    Epidaurus, a city of Peloponnesus, they wasted much of the country
    thereabout and assaulting the city had a hope to take it, though it
    succeeded not. Leaving Epidaurus, they wasted the territories about of
    Troezene, Halias, and Hermione, places all on the seacoast of
    Peloponnesus. Putting off from hence, they came to Prasiae, a small
    maritime city of Laconia, and both wasted the territory about it and took
    and razed the town itself."

*"Another take of that."*

Steal last across the country \\
Under moonlight soft and wet \\
And let the dead of night hide you \\
From things you can't forget \\
Spend daylight in dark tunnels \\
Where the demons rave \\
One day closer every day \\
To Tyler Lambert's grave

Shoplift when you have to \\
Keep your visor low [^shoplift] \\
If your hunger shames you \\
Never let them know [^poverty] \\
Feel your sadness lifting \\
Ride it like a wave \\
It sets you gently down beside \\
Tyler Lambert's grave

Fall into a pattern \\
Never get unstuck \\
Anyone you can't relate \\
Should thank God for his luck

Young man in a yellow tie \\
Hair gel in his hair \\
No context for the picture \\
Just kind of standing there [^photo] \\
Try to step outside the shadow \\
Of your great catastrophe \\
Dream all night of freedom \\
Never wake up free

    "There's the sort of fever that I have and then there's the one that
    chases you to the grave, and this is a song about a young man whose mother
    killed herself when he was very young, and she had been a child star, and
    he couldn't get out from under that. I wrote a song about her when she was
    --- before she died a long, long time ago when she was just robbing Vegas
    drug stores, and --- I know, because it was funny, it was like former
    child star does what former child stars do and rob stuff --- and then she
    died in a trailer in Oklahoma and it was tragic and twenty years later her
    son followed her and this is called Tyler Lambert's Grave." --- Soho
    Restaurant, Santa Barbara, June 24, 2011

    "In 1993 or '94, I wrote a song about Dana Plato, who was then a former
    child star on a downward slide; her story seemed so sad to me. She died
    young, a few years later, leaving a son behind. His name was Tyler
    Lambert, and he took his life last year, and the news stories I read ran a
    picture of this young man looking like young men often look: full of hope
    and promise, at the beginning of life. My heart broke for all the pain in
    that family, and I wrote the song... The song is about how sometimes we're
    walking around with scars that seem so deep that it feels like they'll
    never heal, and how hard it can be to believe that they'll ever stop
    bleeding, and how sometimes we see somebody who doesn't make it and we
    feel a kinship with that person, a shared grief. That feeling of horror
    and sadness when somebody doesn't make it, that sadness over wishing
    someone could have helped. The way you sometimes see your own face in the
    image of somebody who never quite got free of his demons." Williams, Joe

    The composer is tagged as "John 'the Bloomington Bruiser' Darnielle", the
    genre as "Self-Help", and the album as "Twitter Reward Bonus". An
    additional comment is added, being, "Strings arranged & played by Leanne
    Zacharias who is awesome."

[^lambert]:
    Tyler Lambert was the son of [Dana
    Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Plato), a former child star
    famous for playing Kimberley Drummond on the American sitcom Diff'rent
    Strokes. Plato was let go from the show when she became pregnant with
    Lambert. Struggling with drug abuse and poverty, she committed suicide on
    May 8, 1999, overdosing on carisoprodol and alcohol in her trailer.
    Lambert committed suicide by shooting himself in the head on May 6, 2010,
    25 years old.

[^shoplift]:
    John reports this couplet as being his favorite lines in the song. As
    mentioned in the [above banter](#fn:lambertjohn), Tyler Lambert's mother,
    Dana Plato, was arrested for robbing a video store in Las Vegas with a
    pellet gun for less than $200.

Their Bones." \\
"Yeah." \\
"Yes. By the Mountain Goats. It's from Star Wars, the new one, it's not in
theaters yet. Two, three, four."*

Stay true to the path, young Jedi [^jedi] \\
Cleave to the precepts you've been given \\
Remember those who went before and cleared a way for you \\
Let your deeds give hope and comfort to the living \\
Let your deeds give hope and comfort to the living

Do your best in city or in swampland \\
Peace over anger, honor over hate \\
At the end of all your days, one Jedi waits for you \\
With the dust of Jedi bones piled high like parsnips on his plate \\
With the dust of Jedi bones piled up like parsnips on his plate

Specifically just their bones \\
All the soft parts you can keep \\
It's the bones that have the calcium, so he says \\
The long feast will be filmed for mass consumption \\
The cameras Rian's [^rian] got these days are unimaginably high-res

Despair not for the end that waits for you \\
Fear not the fire in which your flesh must burn \\
All the Jedi from all the planets in this putrid universe \\
Get eaten by this last one, and now it's your turn \\
They get eaten by this last one, and now it's your turn

Bones, bones, bones, bones, bones [^chatter] \\
Bones, bones, bones, bones, bones \\
The ultimate Jedi who wastes all the other Jedi has eaten up all their bones \\
All their bones, bones, bones, bones, bones

    program *Breaking Bad*, the neo-noir film *Brick*, and many other films,
    including the upcoming *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*, the second film in the
    *Star Wars* sequel trilogy. The song was written and developed after a
    joking Twitter exchange between John and Rian after Rian annouced the
    title for *Star Wars VIII* (Rian's first post included a photo with the
    title screen and a link to a brief teaser article about the film):

    > Rian: Excited (and relieved) to finally share this!
    > <https://t.co/QKzA21tuog>
    >
    > John: my five-year campaign to sell Rian on the title "The Ultimate Jedi

    > Rian: [@mountain_goats](https://twitter.com/mountain_goats) WRITE THIS SONG

    > John: [@rianjohnson](https://twitter.com/rianjohnson) Rian I'm a man who
    > likes to spend his daylight hours working <https://t.co/YhsuMjHAgu>

    The final post in that exchange featured a photo of John's table ---
    with a copy of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons *Fiend Folio* nearby ---
    with a page of draft lyrics.

    Several days later, Rian posted:

    > So [@mountain_goats](https://twitter.com/mountain_goats) and I were joking
    > around, one thing led to another, he recorded this song and now it's
    > canon. <https://t.co/0vCdZTO6iO>

    with a link to the song on Soundcloud. John explained further:

    >
    > ...I was joking around with
    > [@rianjohnson](https://twitter.com/rianjohnson) about his big Star Wars

    >
    > if you enjoyed me & Rian goofing around pls 1) go see the Star Wars movie

    The song was later announced on the Mountain Goats blog:

    > I was joking around [with Rian Johnson on
    > Twitter](https://twitter.com/rianjohnson/status/824996100985589760) and

## With Their Flesh, He'll Create [^fleshjohn] [^fleshseries] [^gorguts] ## {#flesh}

*"One, two. One, two, three, and."*

God itself, for him has always been \\
A stupid, grotesque person worthless to believe in \\
With the help of his sick morbidous studies \\
He denied God's existence with demented theories

Well, he could revive, immortalize \\
The coldest flesh now dead for a while \\
Limbs of those forgotten structures his creation \\
Which now awaits the omnious resurrection

With their flesh, he'll create \\
Yeah, with their flesh, he'll create

The light of life, which through his syringe glows \\
Soon, in the veins the soul will flow \\
Injections in a body once deceased, reanimates \\
The flesh-made puzzle soon will start to breathe, regenerate

Removing stiffness in every limb \\
Metabolism of life has started from within \\
And terrified, he beholds the rise of his creation \\
Guided by an artificial soul, zombified, uncontrolled

'Cause with their flesh, he'll create \\
Yeah, with their flesh, he'll create [^finalverse]

## You & Me & a High Balcony [^balconyjohn] [^balconyseries] ## {#balcony}

*"Two, three, four."*

Clean slate \\
Warm weather \\
They should tie \\
Our ankles both together

Seagulls calling \\
To one another \\
If a stranger should ask you \\
You can tell him I'm your brother

Lean into me, press real hard \\
I got no good reasons left \\
Not to let down my guard \\
I love your kiss \\
But it's going to come \\
Down to this

You and me and a high balcony \\
And professional wrestling on pay-per-view [^ppv] \\
Windows and light \\
And the radio blaring all night \\
And the truth slowing dawning \\
On me and then on you

Let's pretend \\
We're all alone \\
Let's unplug the \\
Telephone

Our scale \\
Doesn't slide \\
Here comes tonight \\
Hey, open wide

Don't blink \\
Don't try too hard not too \\
Just rehearse the alibis \\
Your father taught you \\
See the plastic coating on the windows blister \\
Anybody asks you, tell 'em you're my sister, yeah \\
You and me and a table set for three \\
Just in case our assassin should finally come through \\
Anhydrous and matches, [^methamphetamine] why don't we \\
Cook up two more batches \\
With the time closing in \\
On me and then on you

    Released on Twitter and Tumblr when he ran into a CD containing it at his
    home:

    "ha wow ok NO recollection of this song. office cleaning wins again

    "Why the hell not? Song I ran across on a CD while cleaning the office:
    [johndarnielle.tumblr.com/post/557984027...](http://johndarnielle.tumblr.com/post/55798402747/ok-so-earlier-on-twitter-i-mentioned-that-i-ran)

    "song appears to be about two meth cooks about to run out of luck,
    possible a brother-sister duo

    "there's no name on the CD, I have no idea what this song was initially
    called

    "I suspect that's right \[that this resembles an Extra Glenns song\], but
    thematically it's a \[sic\] more in tMG territory"

    Remarking further on Tumblr, John wrote:

    "OK so earlier on Twitter I mentioned that I ran across a CD marked 'New
    '02' while 'cleaning the office.' It consists, on auditing, of a bunch of
    songs that were new in 2002. Plenty of them got recorded at Bear Creek for
    *We Shall All Be Healed*; some didn't. This one seemed worth letting out
    of its lonely cage. It audibly doesn't really belong with the songs from
    *We Shall All Be Healed*: it shares some themes (meth, tawdry motels) but
    is formally in a pretty different ballpark and it's also not very
    personal, whereas the songs that *did* end up making *We Shall All Be
    Healed* marked my first steps toward writing from direct experience."

    His additional comment on SoundCloud:

    "lovers rock. not actually on "all west texas" though if you enjoyed this
    tune and wanna extravagantly express your thanks, please click the "buy"
    link and buy "all hail west texas." I will see you at the top of the
    charts"

    [Pay-per-view](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view) is a type of
    cable television widely used for films and sports in which the viewer pays
    for a single view of a scheduled event, as opposed to paying for a channel
    subscription or for on-demand content.

[^methamphetamine]:
    [Anhydrous ammonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia) and [red
    phosphorous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes_of_phosphorus#Red_phosphorus)
    are essential components of two major synthetic pathways for manufacturing
    methamphetamine. The former uses a dissolving metal reduction, usually
    with ammonia and lithium, often stolen from batteries, to remove the
    alcohol from ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, forming methamphetamine (while
    this reaction is often called the Birch reduction method, it differs from
    the canonical Birch reduction in that it does not reduce the benzene ring
    to a 1,4-cyclohexadiene). The latter uses red phosphorus (often obtained
    from match heads) in hydroiodic acid to initially form iodoephedrine from
    ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, which is then reduced to methamphetamine.
    The initial amounts of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are generally
    obtained from over-the-counter medications.
