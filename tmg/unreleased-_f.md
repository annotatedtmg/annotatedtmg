## 02-75 [^daytrotterlyrics] ## {#n02-75}

I got your letter \\
And I read what it said \\
And I blushed with recognition \\
At every word you said

And you are my best friend \\
And I have always known you

I dreamed of your house \\
And I looked around \\
And I saw the real rain \\
Real power rolling down

And you, you are my best friend \\
And I have always known you

  These lyrics were transcribed from the [Daytrotter session][daytrotter] performance on May 26, 2008.

## 15--2 ## {#n15-2}

Those may be the most beautiful shades of red I've ever seen \\
Those may be the most beautiful shades of red I've ever seen \\
But don't be fooled \\
If the sun goes down on us here tonight \\
It's not gonna be alright anymore

None of this has anything really to do with us, that's my belief \\
As the desert sky throws the glowing neon into bold relief \\
Your mouth is open and your eyes are wide \\
Hold on, because it's dark outside now

The smell of roses comes thickly through the open window now \\
The smell of roses comes thickly through the open window now \\
As the darkness closes in, our bodies draw the roses in \\
And those may be the most beautiful shades of red i've ever seen

## Abandoning My Father Talking Blues ## {#talking}

It was 9 AM when the U-Haul came \\
And I heard my momma call my name \\
My dad taught English at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo \\
He was at work that day \\
It was time to go \\
We were moving

I was 5 years old and my sister was 3 \\
I was wondering what'd likely become of me \\
My sister looked sad and I tried to be strong \\
It was hard just to get up and move along \\
We were moving

By 5 in the afternoon we were gone \\
And my stepfather welcomed me with open arms \\
We walked right through that apartment door \\
I had never lived in an apartment before \\
It was weird

I'll probably never know what it was like that night \\
For my dad, but I'd wager it was pretty bad \\
My sister and me, we stayed up late \\
Talking in the dark, not feeling so great \\
We were moving

Out of our house \\
Into a two-story apartment building across town \\
With a swingset and a sandbox out in the parking lot \\
And a laundry room with four glistening washing machines \\
And two dryers

Keep the home fires \\
Burning \\
Keep the home fires \\
Burning \\
Keep the home, home fires

## Agemo's Hoops [^agemocologne] ## {#agemo}

You were breathing against my throat \\
Covering your laugh up with your long black overcoat \\
All circuits warming up \\
And you told me what you were going to do \\
And I promised to do the same thing too

And the air \\
The air in New England \\
Was pure  \\
Poison

The car was parked out back among the trees \\
Your voice was getting higher by slow degrees \\
You were giving me directions \\
And you told me where I came from \\
Well God bless us, every one

And the air \\
The air in New England \\
Was pure \\
Poison, poison, poison, poison

## All Frosting [^glenns] [^frostinglive] ## {#frosting}

Let's meet out in San Bernardino \\
Let's get a case of Polish vodka \\
Let's bring out the big guns \\
The modified Israeli ones

Let's go back to where we let it all go \\
Let's quit scavenging for bones down in the snow \\
Let's follow the freeway from here \\
Let's disappear

Let's get our stuff back from the pawnshop \\
Let's put a bedroom in the attic \\
Let's stay up real late \\
And see if we don't suffocate

Let's practice our smiles 'til we're they're freezing cold \\
Let's dig up the graveyard 'til we find ourselves some gold \\
I'll tell you when the coast is clear \\
Let's disappear

[^glenns]:
  This is an Extra Glenns song.

## Alpha Aquae [^aquaelive] ## {#aquae}

I've grown rather tired \\
Of our little game \\
You ask me the question \\
My answer's the same

And I couldn't say \\
The day or the year \\
But it must be summer, 'cause there's flies in here \\
I need water \\
I need water

Ants on the window ledge \\
Caught my attention \\
And I wanted to say so \\
But I was too tired to mention it

And we crawled in bed \\
And melted together \\
Cursing each other \\
Cursing the weather \\
And I need water \\
I need water

  These lyrics were transcribed from a live performance at Absolutely Kosher House, San Francisco, March 5, 2000.

## Alpha Chum Gatherer [^chumlive] ## {#chum}

Rise up real early shaking \\
Try to steady my hand \\
Make my way down to the water \\
Sail a half a mile from land \\

See where the sharks have been breeding \\
Out on the ocean alone \\
And I scrutinize the carnage \\
Like it was the goddamn Rosetta Stone

When I crack \\
That secret code \\
It's sure to lighten my load \\
Wonâ€™t you come out sailing with me \\
Into the warmth of the afternoon 

Scoop up the guts and brains \\
Drizzle them into a plastic bag \\
Let 'em drop onto the deck \\
Feel the day drag

And when I get back to the car \\
It's like a furnace inside \\
And I head on down the highway \\
Throttle open wide

Back home in the high heat \\
I spill out all my presents for you \\
There's blood all over the floor now \\
What are we going to do

Won't you come out sailing with me \\
Into the warmth of the afternoon

## Any Available Surface [^surfacelive] ## {#surface}

I waved at you when you hit the disappearing point \\
Turned in for the night the next day around ten \\
I caught the sweet scent of your hair on my pillowcase \\
Felt so much in love, I felt like myself again \\

Someday the only thing I want to rely upon \\
Is any available surface that you've rested your head on \\

Back in the cave I traced the arc of our awakening \\
Shimmering down in the darkness like hidden gold \\
And I said my secret to myself out loud again \\
We may live to see miracles, if our faith can hold

Someday the only thing I want to rely upon \\
Is any available surface that you've rested your head on

  These lyrics were transcribed from a live performance at Swedish American Hall, San Francisco, February 25, 2009.
