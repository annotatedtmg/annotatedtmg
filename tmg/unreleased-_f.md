## 02-75 ## {#n02-75}

I got your letter \\
And I read what it said \\
And I blushed with recognition \\
At every word you said

And you are my best friend \\
And I have always known you

I dreamed of your house \\
And I looked around \\
And I felt the real rain \\
Rolling down

And you are my best friend \\
And I have always known you

## 15--2 ## {#n15-2}

Those may be the most beautiful shades of red I've ever seen \\
Those may be the most beautiful shades of red I've ever seen \\
But don't be fooled \\
If the sun goes down on us here tonight \\
It's not gonna be all right anymore

None of this has anything really to do with us, that's my belief \\
As the desert sky throws the glowing neon into bold relief \\
Your mouth is open and your eyes are wide \\
Hold on, because it's dark outside now

The smell of roses comes thickly through the open window now \\
The smell of roses comes thickly through the open window now \\
As the darkness closes in, our bodies draw the roses in \\
And those may be the most beautiful shades of red I've ever seen

## 25 ## {#n25}

In the front seat at about four in the morning \\
Something came down without much warning \\
It was bright and shiny and real nice \\
And it prepared us both for the sacrifice \\
I know what it is, and I know what it means \\
But it's got wings \\
I know what it is, and I know what it means \\
But it's got wings

In the front seat, you know what I mean \\
That thing came down on us bright and hot and pure and clean and ready \\
Ready for the kill, and I'll get ready \\
But hold my hand, would you please hold me steady \\
I know what it is, and I know what it means \\
But it's got wings \\
I know what it is, and I know what it means \\
But it's got wings

## Abandoning My Father Talking Blues ## {#talking}

It was 9 AM when the U-Haul came \\
And I heard my momma call my name \\
My dad taught English at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo \\
He was at work that day \\
It was time to go \\
We were moving

I was 5 years old and my sister was 3 \\
I was wondering what'd likely become of me \\
My sister looked sad and I tried to be strong \\
It was hard just to get up and move along \\
We were moving

But by 5 in the afternoon we were gone \\
And my stepfather welcomed me with open arms \\
We walked right through that apartment door \\
I had never lived in an apartment before \\
It was weird

I'll probably never know what it was like that night \\
For my dad, but I'd wager it was pretty bad \\
My sister and me, we stayed up late \\
Talking in the dark, not feeling so great \\
We were moving

Out of our house \\
Into a two-story apartment building across town \\
With a swingset in a sandbox in the middle of a parking lot \\
And a laundry room with four glistening washing machines \\
And two dryers

Keep the home fires \\
Burning \\
Keep the home fires \\
Burning \\
Keep the home, home fires

## Agemo's Hoops ## {#agemo}

You were breathing against my throat \\
Covering your laugh up with your long black overcoat \\
All circuits warming up

And you told me what you were going to do \\
And I promised to do the same thing too \\
And the air \\
The air in New England \\
Was pure \\
Poison

The car was parked out back among the trees \\
Your voice was getting higher by slow degrees \\
You were giving me directions

And you told me where I came from \\
Well, God bless us, every one \\
And the air \\
The air in New England \\
Was pure \\
Poison, poison, poison, poison

## Alpha Chum Gatherer ## {#chum}

Rise up real early shaking \\
Try to steady my hand \\
Make my way down to the water \\
Sail a half a mile from land \\

See where the sharks have been breeding \\
Out on the ocean alone \\
And I scrutinize the carnage \\
Like it was the goddamn Rosetta Stone

When I crack \\
That secret code \\
It's sure to lighten my load \\
Won't you come out sailing with me \\
Into the warmth of the afternoon 

Scoop up the guts and brains \\
Drizzle them into a plastic bag \\
Watch 'em drop onto the deck \\
Feel the day drag

And when I get back to the car \\
It's like a furnace inside \\
And I head on down the highway \\
Throttle open wide

Back home in the high heat \\
I spill out all my presents for you \\
There's blood all over the floor now \\
What are we going to do

Won't you come out sailing with me \\
Into the warmth of the afternoon

## Any Available Surface ## {#surface}

I waved at you when you hit the disappearing point \\
Turned in for the night the next day around ten \\
I caught the sweet scent of your hair on my pillowcase \\
Felt so much in love, I felt like myself again

Someday the only thing I want to rely upon \\
Is any available surface that you've rested your head on

Back in the cave I traced the arc of our awakening \\
Shimmering down in the darkness like hidden gold \\
And I said my secret to myself out loud again \\
We may live to see miracles, if our faith can hold

Someday the only thing I want to rely upon \\
Is any available surface that you've rested your head on

## Birthday Song: This Time Has Gone ## {#birthday}

When the sun came out this morning, I was wide awake \\
I stumbled on down to the kitchen and I cut myself a piece of my birthday cake \\
With raspberry filling in the middle \\
And I thought about you a little \\
And there was a time when you wanted me so bad \\
It was eating you up inside \\
But this time has gone away

I poured myself a tall glass of milk, it was deep and cold \\
And I checked my driver's license, I was 28 years old \\
And there was a time when you wanted me so bad \\
It was eating you up inside \\
But this time has gone away

## Calcutta ## {#calcutta}

Wild donkeys kicking, braying in the meadow \\
Made you wanna kick and bray yourself, at least you said so \\
And you were wild eyed, your lips were flecked with foam \\
'Til warm Calcutta called you home

Twin rivers flowing brought a flush into your cheek \\
At the spot where the trickling streams and rivers meet \\
The wind from off the snowcapped mountain cooled you down \\
'Til warm Calcutta brought you back around

I could hear the prophets yelling in the street \\
How your eyes were pure poison, but your skin was sweet

## The Car Song ## {#carsong}

The highway's open and the sun is full \\
And the vinyl upholstery heats up like worsted wool \\
The hills roll past us, then they rear up again \\
Take a deep breath now and count to ten \\
I reach across the stick shift and I pull you near \\
The highway's open and it's hot in here \\
It's hot in here

Your skin sends all the sunlight back to hell \\
And you shine in the coming darkness and I guess it's just as well \\
That there's no one left, there's no one left at all \\
And then the hills behind your eyes start burning like a solid ball of licking flames \\
They burn red and clear \\
The highway's open and it's hot in here \\
It's hot in here

## Carmen Cicero ## {#carmencicero}

There's power in the name \\
But the name's been lost for centuries \\
There's poison in the water \\
But the water tastes like honey \\
And we're so thirsty we don't care \\
Where we wake up tomorrow \\
We don't care \\
The question can hardly hold our attention

And this is a song for your young men to sing \\
When they run out of options \\
Yeah when they run out of options

There's the faith you can give or withhold \\
And then there's the one true faith \\
There's the revolution you came for \\
And the one you're eventually going to get \\
And there's a road that starts right here \\
And leads clear up to Saskatchewan \\
And I brought a full tank and a '67 Mustang

And this is a song for your young women to whistle while they're driving \\
At high speeds down the highway

There's wind up in the trees \\
There's a song on the wind \\
There's a message in the song \\
But the message is hopelessly complicated \\
And the words are written on water \\
And they disappear before you can write them down \\
But I, I brought the Polaroid

And this is the song \\
And everybody's gotta sing along \\
But it hasn't got a chorus \\
Goddamn it all

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah \\
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah \\
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah \\
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah \\
Hey hey, la la la la

## Casetino's Nursery ## {#casetino}

The mailman brought the mail by \\
But the devil sent the rain \\
The mailman brought the mail by \\
But the devil sent the rain \\
The rain tore through the streets \\
Tore down Los Flores Canyon again

If the leak was in the attic \\
Then we'd all be doomed for sure \\
If a leak was in the attic \\
Then we'd all be doomed for sure \\
There's a leak up in the attic \\
Honey, let's get out of here

Gotta keep moving, gotta keep me moving \\
Blues falling down like hail \\
Gotta keep me moving \\
Blues falling down like hail \\
The sunlight keeps to worrying me \\
There's a hellhound on my trail

## Chilean Fire Barrel ## {#firebarrel}

Smell of sulfur, cloven hoof \\
Birds were gathering on the roof \\
Faint voices, scratching sounds \\
If this keeps up, I may never come down

By the time I snapped out of it, there was nothing left \\
By the time I snapped out of it, there was nothing left \\
By the time I snapped out of it, you were long gone \\
By the time I snapped out of it, you were long gone

Spinning numbers, shepherd songs \\
Birds singing all the time, all wrong \\
Aunt Margaret, cotton-eyed Joe \\
They swear they're my friends, but I don't think so

By the time I snapped out of it, there was nothing left \\
By the time I snapped out of it, there was nothing left \\
By the time I snapped out of it, you were long gone \\
By the time I snapped out of it, you were long gone

## Cutter [^cutterjohn]  ## {#cutter}

I'd been living hand to mouth for a year or better \\
When the mailman comes and brings me your letter \\
And I recognize the handwriting even now \\
But I go ahead and open it anyhow \\
Yeah, and no one's been buying from my roadside stand \\
And I hold your letter like a cross in my hand \\
I'm gonna wrap up my troubles \\
I am gonna wrap up my troubles \\
I am gonna wrap up my troubles \\
In you

I went out into the kitchen where the light comes through \\
The 4-paneled window clean and bright \\
And it's taken me this long to realize \\
How much I like the way that you dot your Is \\
I was born in Indiana thirty years ago \\
I got a mean, cruel hunger down below \\
And I'm gonna wrap up my troubles \\
I am gonna wrap up my troubles \\
I am gonna wrap up all my troubles \\
In you

[^cutterjohn]:
    "This is a song that has two truths in it, which is up to you to ferret
    out... The title of this song is a term of abuse for a person from where
    I'm from. You may remember it from the movie Breaking Away." ---
    University of Wisconsin--Madison, Madison, June 12, 1997.

## The Doll Song ## {#dollsong}

I had seven little dolls \\
In a bag \\
And I told them my troubles \\
And the dolls said, nag, nag, nag, nag \\
It's all you ever do \\
Is that all you're capable of \\
And I said to the little dolls \\
You have no compassion

Baby, I'm talking to inanimate objects over you \\
I'm talking to inanimate objects over you

I was reading the Bible \\
1 Corinthians 13 \\
Where Paul talks all about love \\
But I don't know what he means \\
Because he says that love is kind \\
That has not been my experience \\
So I set the Bible down on the kitchen table \\
And yelled at the Bible 'til I was no longer able

Baby, I'm talking to inanimate objects over you \\
I'm talking to inanimate objects over you \\
Yeah, I'm talking to inanimate objects over you \\
Yeah, I'm talking to inanimate objects over you

## Down to the Ark ## {#ark}

*"Right. Down to the Ark."*

The candidates met up in North Dakota \\
And they donned their black robes there in the chapel hall \\
They said a brief invocation to their cloven-hoofed prints \\
And they signed their names in blood on the vestry wall

In Christ, you know there's neither high nor low \\
And the void will claim all creatures small or bright \\
Seal up the borders or let everybody in \\
In the order of the serpent there'll be neither left nor right

And we pull down our blindfolds \\
Reach out for the lever in the dark \\
Get a sticker for our shirts as we head into the sun \\
Proudly bearing the mark \\
Headed down to the ark

The applicants went down to Oklahoma \\
And they hired an accent coach to teach 'em the Western twang \\
And several post-born babies learned the hard way \\
Vampires only kiss you when they've sharpened up their fangs \\
Yeah

And as Minnesota fell, so went Missouri \\
We were meeting at VFWs in the snow \\
And we voted down the tax codes, and we voted down the war \\
So many names to choose from, just one way to go

And we pull down our blindfolds \\
Reach out for the lever in the dark \\
Get a sticker for our shirts as we head into the sun \\
Proudly bearing the mark \\
Headed down to the ark

## Edvard Munch [^oslo1888] ## {#edvard}

Radical colors on the eastern sky \\
The blinding symmetry, the little white lie \\
Your small hand waving in the cold air \\
The ridges of the mountain frozen on the skyline there

When the sun came out over Norway today \\
I saw you going away \\
There was nothing good in your going \\
There was nothing good in your going

I cut the flowers that grew near the door \\
And I arranged them in the center of the floor \\
And the room was so empty \\
There were pale shadows inside

When the sun came out over Norway today \\
I saw you going away \\
There was nothing good in your going \\
There was nothing good in your going

[^oslo1888]:
    Sometimes called [Oslo 1888](unreleased-mr.html#oslo), although this is
    its own song. See Slattery's, Dublin, November 22, 1996.

## Elizabeth Barrett Browning ## {#browning}

I saw the building burning down \\
I saw the dogs come running in two by two \\
I saw the feast of Saint Christopher beginning \\
I drew connecting lines between these things

You say I need to get some sleep \\
You say I need to take it easy for a while \\
You say I'll never learn to swim at this rate \\
But I'm waiting for you downstairs \\
And the water's rushing in on me

So I guess the wheel's been set in motion \\
I guess the ship, it's gone and left it's little harbor \\
I guess we'll wait and see what happens to us next \\
And I can't wait because there's rats in the walls \\
There are rats in the walls \\
There are rats in the walls \\
There are rats in the walls \\
There are rats in the walls \\ \\
There are rats beneath the floorboards \\
Rats up in the ceiling \\
Rats in the walls \\
There are rats in the walls

## Ethiopians ## {#ethiopians}

Window-mounted air conditioning unit \\
Humming like a hive \\
We want to send postcards to the friends we used to have \\
Rub their noses in the ugly fact \\
That we are still alive

And we play \\
Lover's reggae \\
On accordion and banjo \\
When the moon is high

And we lie \\
On the floor \\
Get suspicious of the people \\
Who've just moved in next door

The bad taste in our mouths \\
The twinkle in your eye \\
Good things never last \\
Bad things never die

Wind chime from Tahiti that we found down at the auction \\
Tolls its minor chord \\
And I can't think of one thing in this whole wide blessed world \\
That's more dangerous and frightening \\
Than you when you get bored

We go through \\
Scads of money \\
Don't know where it comes from \\
Don't know where it goes

And we stare \\
Out the window \\
See the poison flowers the neighbors grow \\
Sprouting up in nice neat rows

The swelling in our limbs \\
The twinkle in your eye \\
Good things never last \\
Bad things never die

## Etiquette Song ## {#etiquette}

Rain washing your memory away \\
Fires burning somewhere around here \\
Clouds forming, clouds gathering \\
One minute in a long, long year

You got one good reason \\
For doing what you're going to do \\
I got one thing holding me back \\
From doing the same thing to you

In the San Gabriels the fire ate away \\
Rabbitbrush and the Jimson weed \\
When the rain came it was like an old friend \\
When you came by you had just what I needed

You've got one hour left \\
Before something happens all right \\
And then rain will come down tonight

## Eugene Sue ## {#eugene}

*"Oh yes, you bobble <unintelligible> the top of the thirteenth. It looks like
Joe Girardi."*

When the sky opens wide \\
And the late winter rain goes wild \\
I don't like it \\
And I curse God to His face 

And I say to myself \\
And to anyone else who will listen \\
Save yourselves, or hang yourselves \\
But I am leaving this wretched place

But when you call down curses \\
On the God that made you \\
You play hide and seek with trouble \\
Trouble's gonna find you too

When the ship finds land \\
And they throw me onto the sand \\
There's a guy with a rifle \\
Waiting there

And I say \\
To nobody listening, this is fine by me \\
And ideas fly through my mind \\
The sweat cakes my hair

Yeah, when you call down curses \\
On the God that made you \\
You play hide and seek with trouble \\
Yes, the trouble's gonna find you too

## Flower Song ## {#flower}

*"Pues no hay nada más profundo \\
Ni más grande en este mundo \\
Que el cariño que te di..."*

Selling new flowers \\
Outrageously cheap \\
Freshly cut daisies \\
Twenty five cents each \\
You loved me when you could keep your losses down \\
But winter's coming around \\
Now, now, now, now

The girl at the flower shop \\
Is kind and young \\
She made accurate change for me \\
I let the change come \\
You loved me when it was cheap to do so \\
Can you feel the cold wind blow \\
Now, now, now, now
