## Abandoning My Father Talking Blues ## {#talking}

It was 9 AM when the U-Haul came \\
And I heard my momma call my name \\
My dad taught English at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo \\
He was at work that day \\
It was time to go \\
We were moving

I was 5 years old and my sister was 3 \\
I was wondering what'd likely become of me \\
My sister looked sad and I tried to be strong \\
It was hard just to get up and move along \\
We were moving

By 5 in the afternoon we were gone \\
And my stepfather welcomed me with open arms \\
We walked right through that apartment door \\
I had never lived in an apartment before \\
It was weird

I'll probably never know what it was like that night \\
For my dad, but I'd wager it was pretty bad \\
My sister and me, we stayed up late \\
Talking in the dark, not feeling so great \\
We were moving

Out of our house \\
Into a two-story apartment building across town \\
With a swingset and a sandbox out in the parking lot \\
And a laundry room with four glistening washing machines \\
And two dryers

Keep the home fires \\
Burning \\
Keep the home fires \\
Burning \\
Keep the home, home fires

## Down to the Ark [^arkjohn] [^arkseries] [^ark] ## {#ark}

*"Right. Down to the Ark."*

The candidates met up in North Dakota [^supertuesday] \\
And they donned their black robes there in the chapel hall \\
They said a brief invocation to their cloven-hoofed prince [^cloven] \\
And they signed their names in blood on the vestry wall

In Christ, you know there's neither high nor low [^romans839] \\
And the void will claim all creatures small or bright [^allcreatures] \\
Seal up the borders or let everybody in \\
In the order of the serpent, [^serpent] there'll be neither left nor right [^leftright]

And we pull down our blindfolds \\
Reach out for the lever in the dark \\
Get a sticker for our shirts as we head into the sun [^ivoted] \\
Proudly bearing the mark [^revelation13] \\
Headed down to the ark

The applicants went down to Oklahoma [^supertuesday] \\
And they hired an accent coach to teach them the western twang \\
And several post-born babies [^abortion] learned the hard way \\
Vampires only kiss you when they've sharpened up their fangs \\
Yeah

And as Minnesota fell, so went Missouri [^supertuesday]  \\
We were meeting at VFWs [^vfw] in the snow \\
And we voted down the tax codes, and we voted down the war [^votes] \\
So many names to choose from, just one way to go

And we pull down our blindfolds \\
Reach out for the lever in the dark \\
Get a sticker for our shirts as we head into the sun \\
Proudly bearing the mark \\
Headed down to the ark

[^arkjohn]:
    Posting the song, John explained:

    > [Weekend America](http://weekendamerica.publicradio.org/) asked me to
    > write a song for Super Tuesday. Who do you think about when you think
    > about politicians? Right, [me
    > too](http://www.hungry.com/~bernd/Satan.gif). So I wrote
    > [this](http://weekendamerica.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/01/31/mtngoats/),
    > and recorded it [here](http://www.lohostudios.com/), and I hope you
    > enjoy it!

    The link in "me too" is to an image of the word "satan" stylized to look
    like a horned animal. [Weekend America][weekend] was a news and culture
    radio program syndicated by American Public Media, often distributed via
    NPR, the major public radio organization in the United States.

    Speaking more about the song in the recording available on the National
    Public Radio website, John states:

    > My songs have never been me expressing my feelings, or very rarely;
    > they're just, they're formal exercises, you know, and I thought that was
    > an interesting way of putting it. Things tend to be more interesting if
    > you take them to the extremes, I think.
    >
    > Either you're a really good political satirist and you can do something
    > that is poking fun but at the same time not being partisan, you know, or
    > you can't, and I wouldn't --- that's just not sort of what I do. I write
    > little emotional psychodramas. So, you know, then, once I got my hook,
    > that I was gonna portray all the candidates as, you know, people who
    > drink the blood of infants, that was exciting to me. Because that's sort
    > of my political position. I mean, I will vote for the person who comes
    > closest to what I think is right, but I don't trust, you know, or like
    > any of them.
    >
    > ... I was trying not to say that we shouldn't bother voting. I mean, I
    > felt that way for a long time, you know. I believe in voting for the
    > person who's going to do the least harm, almost all of the time, you
    > know. But I remain deeply suspicious of anybody who would seek public
    > office.

[^arkseries]:
    Down to the Ark is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^ark]:
    Given that John was considering Revelation in writing the song ([see
    below](#fn:ivoted)), this more likely refers to the [Ark of the
    Covenant][covenant] than [Noah's Ark][noah]. The Ark of the Covenant is a
    chest believed to contain the stone tablets inscribed with the Ten
    Commandments, brought down by Moses from Mount Sinai. The location and
    definitive existence of the Ark is unknown.

    [Revelation][], the final book of the Bible, is the source of much
    Christian eschatology. It contains an intense, surreal, violent prophecy
    of the apocalypse. In the book, Jesus gives the narrator a vision of
    cosmic war between good and evil, and describes the coming of the Four
    Horsemen of the Apocalpyse, followed by mass slaughter, death, and
    suffering. Ultimately, Jesus promises to return with an army of angels and
    creates a new world, known as the Second Coming.

    As Revelation progresses, the Throne of God appears with a scroll covered
    with seven seals. The opening of the seals release the Horsemen and other
    forces of catastrophic destruction. Following this, seven trumpets are
    sounded, generating further calamities. After the seventh trumpet is
    sounded, the Kingdom of God is declared and the Ark of the Covenant
    appears:

    > God's sanctuary in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant
    > appeared in His sanctuary. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings of
    > thunder, an earthquake, and severe hail.

    [Revelation 11:19][revelation1119], Holman Christian Standard Bible,
    retrieved February 24, 2022.

[^supertuesday]:
    [Super Tuesday][supertuesday] is the colloquial term for the day in the
    United States presidential primary election process when the largest
    number of states vote, which normally has a dramatic effect on which
    candidates are able to continue running their campaigns and ultimately win
    their parties' nominations. In 2008, Super Tuesday, held on [February 5,
    2008][tuesday2008], was larger than ever before, as 24 states held their
    primaries on that day. These states included North Dakota, Oklahoma,
    Minnesota, and Missouri, the states mentioned in this song.

    The Democratic primary was inconclusive between Senators Barack Obama and
    Hillary Clinton, while the Republican primary helped bring former Governor
    Mitt Romney's campaign to an end, but allowed former Governor Mike
    Huckabee's campaign to continue until March, when he conceded the
    nomination to Senator John McCain. Ultimately, the election was won by
    Barack Obama.

[^cloven]:
    A [cloven hoof][cloven] is a hoof with two toes, as with cattle, deer, pigs,
    antelopes, gazelles, goats, mountain goats, and sheep. In Judaism, animals
    that both chew their cud and have cloven hooves are considered kosher,
    while others are considered unclean, or treif. Cloven hooves are often
    associated with Satan, due to Satan often having the body or limbs of a
    goat.

[cloven]:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloven_hoof

[^romans839]:
    A reference to Romans 8:39:

    > For I am persuaded that not even death or life, \\
    > angels or rulers, \\
    > things present or things to come, hostile powers,
    > 
    > height or depth, or any other created thing \\
    > will have the power to separate us \\
    > from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord!

    [Romans 8:38--39][romans8], Holman Christian Standard Bible, retrieved
    February 24, 2022.

[^allcreatures]:
    Likely an allusion to [All Things Bright and Beautiful][allthings], a
    famous hymn by Cecil Alexander, first published in 1848. The hymn opens
    with the lines:

    > All things bright and beautiful, \\
    > All creatures great and small, \\
    > All things wise and wonderful, \\
    > The Lord God made them all.

    This stanza repeats as the chorus.

[allthings]:    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Things_Bright_and_Beautiful

[^serpent]:
    Throughout the Bible, beginning in Genesis with Adam, Eve, the snake, and
    the apple, serpents are associated with Satan. Specifically to Revelation,
    a dragon --- equivalently called the ancient serpent --- arises,
    identified with Satan, and wages war against Heaven. Michael, chief among
    the archangels, fights the dragon and defeats it.

[revelation12]: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12&version=HCSB

[^leftright]:
    In the United States, presidential elections follow a first-past-the-post
    voting system, meaning that the candidate with the most votes wins, even
    if this is a minority of the electorate, or even the voters. This has
    led to a two-party system, where it is nearly impossible for another party
    to gain political prominence. The Republican Party occupies the more
    right-wing and the Democratic Party occupies the more left-wing position,
    although true left-wing positions are essentially unrepresented.

    The left-right dichotomy dates from the French Revolution of 1789. In the
    National Assembly, supporters of the King sat on the right, and supporters
    of the Revolution sat on the left.

[leftright]:    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_political_spectrum

[^ivoted]:
    "The conceit of the chorus is going into the voting booth, and as you
    leave the voting place, they give you a little sticker that says, 'I
    voted', right. The booth is kind of dark, and you go out into the light,
    and I sort of liked that, sort of image from Revelations of people walking
    around with something on their foreheads, you know, that declares that
    they've declared allegiance to the Beast and so forth." --- Weekend
    America session, February 2, 2008

[^revelation13]:
    The infamous Mark of the Beast, a symbol or number associated with Satan.
    In Revelation, there are two beasts. The first beast rises from the sea,
    and is given power by [the serpent](#fn:serpent). The second beast is
    depicted as a false prophet, and places a mark on those that follow it:

    > And he \[the Beast\] requires everyone --- small and great, rich and
    > poor, free and slave—to be given a mark on his right hand or on his
    > forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark: the
    > beast’s name or the number of his name.
    >
    > Here is wisdom: The one who has understanding must calculate the number
    > of the beast, because it is the number of a man. His number is 666.

[^abortion]:
    Likely contrasting to "unborn babies", a common way for anti-abortionists
    to describe a fetus. Opposition to abortion is a major mobilizing force
    among part of the right-wing in the United States.

[^vfw]:
    The [Veterans of Foreign Wars][vfw] is an 1899 American organization
    formed of, as the title suggests, American military veterans who fought
    outside the United States. VFW halls are common in towns throughout the
    United States and are common sites for a variety of public events,
    including hosting polling stations.

[vfw]:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_of_Foreign_Wars

[^votes]:
    I'm not aware of these referring to specific ballot items on Super Tuesday
    --- if you are, please [let me know](about.html#contact), as usual! Likely
    these refer to opposing the [Bush tax cuts][taxcuts], which benefited the
    wealthiest people in the United States, and the wars in [Iraq][iraqwar]
    and [Afghanistan][afghanwar], both illegal and criminal wars by the Bush
    administration and continued by the Obama administration. The United
    States military was heavily engaged in other wars, including in Yemen,
    Pakistan, Somalia, and elsewhere, at the time of the election in 2008.
