## Abandoning My Father Talking Blues ## {#talking}

It was 9 AM when the U-Haul came \\
And I heard my momma call my name \\
My dad taught English at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo \\
He was at work that day \\
It was time to go \\
We were moving

I was 5 years old and my sister was 3 \\
I was wondering what'd likely become of me \\
My sister looked sad and I tried to be strong \\
It was hard just to get up and move along \\
We were moving

By 5 in the afternoon we were gone \\
And my stepfather welcomed me with open arms \\
We walked right through that apartment door \\
I had never lived in an apartment before \\
It was weird

I'll probably never know what it was like that night \\
For my dad, but I'd wager it was pretty bad \\
My sister and me, we stayed up late \\
Talking in the dark, not feeling so great \\
We were moving

Out of our house \\
Into a two-story apartment building across town \\
With a swingset and a sandbox out in the parking lot \\
And a laundry room with four glistening washing machines \\
And two dryers

Keep the home fires \\
Burning \\
Keep the home fires \\
Burning \\
Keep the home, home fires
