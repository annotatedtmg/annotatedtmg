[^dilaudid]:
    Dilaudid is a common brand name for [hydromorphone
    hydrochloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydromorphone), an extremely
    potent opiate analgesic. Several times more potent than heroin, it has
    high recreational abuse potential alongside numerous medical uses for
    treatment of severe pain.

### Liner notes [^download] ### {#liner}

the first two tracks on this download only ep are taken from the bands
forthcoming 3rd album for 4ad. on previous albums songwriter john darnielle
created songs around a fictional theme, however his last album for us, 'we
shall all be healed' marked a change in his songwriting approach by revisiting
and reconstructing a dark period in his early life; a time of seedy
apartments, makeshift friendships, cheap substances and unscheduled trips to
hospital. this new record goes further still. darnielle's stepfather died in
december 2003; and shortly afterwards, as the mountain goats toured europe,
these new, intensely personal songs started to flow. they were begun in a
paris hotel, worked on in dingy dressing rooms and hired vans, and four of
them were road-tested in a wonderful session recorded for john peel at the end
of the tour.

[^download]:
    Dilaudid was a digital-only released downloadable from 4AD's website.
    [^dilaudidrelease] The cover images were provided with the download,
    however, no physical media has ever been available. The image erroneously
    lists This Year as Dance Music, which was not included.

    These liner notes are taken from the image on [Nall's site](#links), which
    appears to be a promotional CD that was not available for official
    release.

## Collapsing Stars [^starsseries] [^starsdemo] [^collapse] ## {#collapsing}

When we hid out behind the risers [^risers] at the high school \\
Working bitter calculations with a slide rule \\
The grim particulars of poisoning the swimming pool \\
Well, you looked me in the eye \\
Ready to die

We were becoming what we are \\
Collapsing stars

When we chewed up pseudoephedrine [^pseudoephedrine] [^aspirin] [^tylenol] like bubblegum \\
'Til our hearts were beating deep and rich as kettle drums \\
We knew if we waited long enough the change would come \\
And then the day did come, and at last

Hold tight \\
Hold fast \\
Catch lightning in a jar \\
Collapsing stars

I told you to load up on provisions \\
'Cause we wouldn't be back for a while \\
Load up your troubles in your old kit bag \\
Turn toward the camera and smile, smile, smile

When we ditched the plan to poison all our enemies \\
Tucked our weapons in a clearing and covered them with leaves [^stuffed]  \\
We are gonna come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves [^sheaves] \\
One day, and we are on our way

You can look, but you won't find \\
Another love like ours \\
Collapsing stars

[^starsseries]:
    Collapsing Stars is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible) and [informal series of
    demos](series.html#demos).

[^starsdemo]:
    A demo of Collapsing Stars was released on the [Come, Come to the Sunset
    Tree](ccst.html) bonus LP.

[^collapse]:
    [Star collapse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_collapse) is
    the final stage in the evolution of a star. As a star generates light and
    heat through nuclear fusion, it increases in size, with its thermal
    pressure resisting gravitational forces. Over billions of years, it
    expends all its fuel, and the star subsequently collapses into a compact
    star, ejecting its outer layers to form a planetary nebula. This process
    takes tens of thousands of years. Depending on whether the mass of the
    star is above or below the Chandrasekhar limit, the post-collapse star
    will either be a white dwarf or a neutron star; truly enormous stars above
    the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff limit collapse below their Schwarzschild
    radius to form black holes.

[^risers]:
    [Risers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_risers) are a type of
    seating platform similar to bleachers.

[^pseudoephedrine]:
    [Pseudoephedrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoephedrine) is an
    over-the-counter decongestant. Being only a single hydroxyl group away
    from methamphetamine, it is often illegally used for methamphetamine
    synthesis. It is also used recreationally or off-label to improve
    alertness or as a performance-enhancing drug in athletics.

[^aspirin]:
    Sung as, "When we chewed up baby aspirin like bubblegum" on the
    [demo](#fn:starsdemo). [Baby
    aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin#Dosage) refers to aspirin
    in 81 mg tablets, generally taken for prevention of heart attacks. The
    nomenclature, although persisting to the modern era, does not imply that
    use is appropriate for infants; aspirin in any dosage should not be given
    to children due to the risk of [Reye
    syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reye_syndrome).

[^tylenol]:
    Also sung, "When we chewed up children's Tylenol like bubblegum". Tylenol
    is a brand name for
    [acetaminophen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol), an
    over-the-counter mild analgesic. WELH session, January 26, 2005.

[^stuffed]:
    Sung as, "Stuffed our weapons..." on the [demo](#fn:starsdemo).

[^sheaves]:
    A reference to Psalm 126:6:

    > Though one goes along weeping, \\
    > carrying the bag of seed, \\
    > he will surely come back with shouts of joy, \\
    > carrying his sheaves.

    Also inspired by this verse, [Bringing in the
    Sheaves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bringing_In_the_Sheaves) is a gospel
    hymn written by Knowles Shaw.
