# Contact info # {#contact}

You can reach me at: {% include root.contact %}

I love hearing from you, but it can take me a long time to reply. I'm very
sorry and hope you understand.

# Site information # {#site}

Why .org? [RFC 1591][].

[RFC 1591]:     http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1591#section-2

This website was written with [vim][] on [Linux][] systems. The site is
generated with [Jekyll][] using [kramdown][], an excellent extended
implementation of [Markdown][], to produce the HTML. I highly recommend all of
these fine pieces of software.

[linux]:        https://archlinux.org/
[kramdown]:     http://kramdown.gettalong.org
[markdown]:     http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
[python]:       http://python.org
[vim]:          http://www.vim.org
[jekyll]:       http://jekyllrb.com

If you see something anywhere on this site that could be done more cleanly or
semantically, I'd love to hear about it so I can fix it.

# Downloading # {#download}

I occasionally get requests about how to obtain a local copy of this website.
The simplest way is probably using [wget][]:

    $ wget -pkrP tamg -nH https://annotatedtmg.org 

This will convert all the links to point to the local files so everything will
still work, and saves the site to a local directory called `tamg`. wget is
available on all platforms and is free, open source software.

If command line tools are unfamiliar, [contact me](#contact) and I'll try to
help.

[wget]:         https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/

# Contributing #

The Annotated Mountain Goats is presently in an archival state. Further edits
are unlikely, although the future is always uncertain. You are welcome to take
from this work in your own Mountain Goats projects. Please consider crediting
the Annotated Mountain Goats by linking back to the site.

A former guide for contributing, as well as all of the source code, is
available in the [git repository][repo]. This hopefully makes it easier to
navigate if you choose to borrow from the site. You are welcome to reach out
to me using the contact information above if you have questions or just want
to talk.

If you're curious about what is incomplete, a number of albums need lyrics and
annotations. You can see which ones these are by looking at the [discography
on the front page](index.html). Links *in italics* are incomplete: those
prefixed with a dash (-) contain lyrics but have yet to be annotated; those
prefixed with a plus (+) instead need transcription as well.
