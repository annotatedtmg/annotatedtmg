[^wsabhjohn]:
    Set in Southern California, this album describes John's experiences using
    methamphetamine in Portland as a teenager, and to some extent, his use of
    heroin previously in Claremont.

    "So, I set the whole next album in Pomona, California, but just between
    you and me, most of the people, or a fair number of them, are actually
    people I knew in Portland up around 13th and Taylor... The title's kind of
    a joke because we shall not be healed. That's what's kind of sad, but
    funny in a bad way about it." --- Berbati's Pan, Portland, October 3,
    2003\. See also the Dennis Kucinich benefit, San Francisco, February 11,
    2004; City Arts and Lectures, Herbst Theatre, San Francisco, February 24,
    2009.

    "This album is the first autobiographical record I've really ever made.
    There've been hidden pieces of autobiographical stuff in other records,
    but they've always been buried underneath these fiction, you know, and
    these are fictionalized stories, but these stories are based on some time
    I spent in Portland, Oregon when I was 18 or 19 --- 18 and 19 --- and I
    was coming off a very harsh high school relationship into which I had
    gotten into some hard drugs, then I moved to Portland and got into
    different hard drugs, I got into speed, and I was just rolling for about
    nine months. And you meet some very rich --- not in the sense of money ---
    but you meet some very deep, rich people, you know, who are very young,
    and very desperate, and very wounded and, you know, they're not deep in
    the romanticised sense of that they have anything great to say, that you
    can hear and take and apply as a philosophy, but there's an energy and a
    power to that kind of desperation of being young and on speed and hopeless
    and certain that you are going to die within the next couple of years and
    so why not do anything. So those were my friends, those were my people."
    --- VPRO session, Zeldzaam Dwars, March 27, 2004. See also the WXDU
    session, October 1, 2004; KEXP session, May 21, 2004; and the KEXP
    session, June 16, 2005. For information about the recording process, see
    the VPRO session, Zeldzaam Dwars, March 27, 2004.

    John clarifies that the names of people in the songs are not people's real
    names. --- KEXP session, May 21, 2004

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

I let the mice chew through the bandages. One of them was this brown and white
mouse who approached the whole task with a wonderful sense of play. Sparkling
little eyes lightheartedly intent on their work. Magnificent. Every little bit
helps. I would lie there, in the boiling afternoon, watching the mice come and
go, and I would think fondly of you.

I began to compile lists in my head. I remembered having read someplace that
making lists was a way of calming the nerves. For me it only made things
worse.

Emil [^people]

I would reach for the telephone and then suddenly retract my hand as though
I'd nearly grabbed hold of a snake. That was me: letting it slide. Watching
unthinkable things on the stolen VCR hooked up through no small effort to the
cheap bolted-down TV. Eating Milk Duds [^milkduds] all day. Milk Duds and
Charritos. [^charritos] And Royal Crown Cola [^cola] in bottles. You could get
it for cheap up at the Viva. [^viva] For real.

{: .in}

In the great heat of the old motel I could feel the part of me that had been
resisting the final disconnect beginning to wither. The kind of shrinking we
practice turns us into invisible towers of strength. I'm sorry I brought you
into this mess but I'm sorrier still that I'm not dumb enough to sink my arms
in past the elbows. I have this sick feeling there's something really great
past the point of no return. Stupid, huh? I let the mice chew through the
bandages. I sat back and let them go about their joyful business. Ripping and
tearing. They were setting me free.

West side riders know how we hold it down.

*All you people still out on the corner up there by 13th and Taylor near the
Greenhouse, [^greenhouse] this one goes out to you with all the love that's in
me. Brave young scavengers in your fabulous black jeans. \\
Hold on. \\
Hold on with both hands.*

[^riverside]:
    Riverside is the name of many cities and regions in the United States. My
    best guess, given John's history, is that this refers to [Riverside,
    California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside,_California), a large
    Inland Empire city in Southern California, near Claremont.

[^mayfield]:
    [Curtis Mayfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Mayfield) was a
    successful rhythm and blues singer and songwriter focusing on
    African-American civil rights from the late 1950s until his death in 1999.

[^reed]:
    [Lou Reed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Reed) was an American singer,
    guitarist, and lyricist, most famously for the Velvet Underground and as a
    solo artist.

[^badcompany]:
    [Bad Company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Company) is a British rock
    supergroup composed of members from Mott the Hoople and Free, performing
    from the 1970s through the present.

[^walker]:
    [Jerry Jeff Walker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jeff_Walker) is a
    Texan country musician famous for writing the classic country song Mr.
    Bojangles.

[^ready]:
    [Ready for the World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_for_the_World) is
    a rhythm and blues band from Michigan who primarily recorded music in the
    mid-1980s and 1990s.

[^milkduds]:
    [Milk Duds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_Duds) are a brand of caramel
    and cocoa candy.

[^charritos]:
    Charrito means "little cowboy" in Spanish. This perhaps refers to the
    brand of cheap frozen dinners, [El
    Charrito](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Charrito).

[^cola]:
    Royal Crown Cola, or, more commonly, [RC
    Cola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_Cola), is an American brand of
    inexpensive cola soft drink.

[^viva]:
    Viva means "Live!" in Spanish and several other romance languages, often
    used as a colloquial shortening of "Long live... !" It could refer to one
    of any number of stores, and I'm not sure which it would be. My best guess
    is the chain of Viva Bargain Centers in the Los Angeles and Inland Empire
    areas.

[^people]:
    If you know the significance of any of these names, please [let me
    know](about.html#contact)!

[^chavo]:
    [Chavo Guerrero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chavo_Guerrero,_Sr.) was a
    professional wrestler in Los Angeles. John's childhood love of
    professional wrestling and Chavo Guerrero in particular is recorded in
    many places; see the references under [Ox Baker
    Triumphant](babylon.html#oxbaker).

[^oxbaker]:
    [Ox Baker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ox_Baker) was an American
    professional wrestler, whom John noted for his unintelligent malevolence.
    See [Ox Baker Triumphant](babylon.html#oxbaker) for more.

[^wrestlers]:
    [Al Madril](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Madril), [Eddie
    Mansfield](http://www.notinhalloffame.com/home/interviews/477-interview-with-eddy-mansfield),
    and [Black
    Gordman](http://socaluncensored.com/history/hall-of-fame/black-gordman/)
    were Southern California wrestlers. For more on John and professional
    wrestling, see the above footnotes.

[^greenhouse]:
    This could refer to several intersections in Portland: SE 13th and SE
    Taylor is an intersection in the [Buckman
    district](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckman,_Portland,_Oregon) of the
    southeast section, while SW 13th and SW Taylor is an intersection in
    [downtown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Portland). I'm not sure
    which this refers to, and I was unable to find any business named the
    Greenhouse in the area. If you know more than me, please [contact
    me](../about.html#contact).

### Microsite ### {#microsite}

We Shall All Be Healed and Tallahassee both featured microsites on 4AD's
Mountain Goats page. As described by 4AD, "Whereas most Mountain Goats records
--- like last year's 'Tallahassee' --- are entirely fictional, all of the
songs on 'We Shall All Be Healed' are based on people that songwriter John
Darnielle used to know. This, perhaps, accounts for the nervous tension that
crackles through the album, as well as the curious tenderness that surfaces
from time to time... John has created a microsite which will take you further
into the world of the record --- [click

## Slow West Vultures [^vulturesjohn] ## {#vultures}

Breaking the signal 'til it's totally unreadable \\
Drinking the dregs, eating the utterly inedible \\
We do what we do, all for you \\
All dressed up, black hat and white cane \\
Slowing circling the drain \\
Ready for the future \\
Ready for the world about to come

Shooting the sequel before the treatment's even finished [^treatment] [^idontcare] \\
Sanding numbers off the Monojects [^monoject] as our slight returns diminish \\
We are what we are, get in the goddamn car \\
Smiling faces, flawlessly rehearsed \\
We are sleek and beautiful, we are cursed [^bottle] \\
Ready for the future \\
Ready for the world about to come \\
Ah

    "... \[This is\] a song about methamphetamine abuse." ---Troubadour, Los

    "... It's about a bunch of people I used to know. I have moved them
    from Portland, where I knew them, to Pomona, where I'm glad I didn't know
    them." --- Opolis, Norman, Oklahoma ... November 13, 2002.

    "This is a love song to a motel room. You know, the kind of room sometimes
    you got to go to for a couple weeks. People come, and they say, 'What
    happened to you, man? You didn't strike me like the kind of guy that'd be
    living here.' And you say to them, 'Why don't you leave me alone? I don't
    remember this being your business at all.' And they say, 'Yes, but I'm your
    father.' And you say, 'You can't prove that.' And they give you a funny
    look and they leave. And you say, 'This calls for a celebration.'" ---
    Attucks Theatre, March 20, 2009

    "This is a song about how, when sometimes you found it necessary to rob
    the safe at the restaurant where you work, and it's funny, because your
    friends who have good jobs say, 'What good can come of that?' And here I
    quote your friends: 'They *only* have about two thousand dollars in
    there.' If you were honest with your friends, you would say, 'Look. Two
    thousand dollars will buy me a quarter pound of peanut butter crank. And
    I'll be going for a good ten days, off that --- unless I meet up with some
    friends.' Then you may stop to think to yourself, that you're likely to
    meet up with some friends. New friends. People you didn't really know
    until word began to spread in the neighborhood, 'John robbed the safe! And
    he took all 2k, and he bought a quarter pound! He's in room 10, 253 North
    Broadway, you can't miss it! Faces Broadway at an angle, across from the
    Coliseum.' And so there you are with your new friends, listening to King
    Diamond, as you do, high for three days and beginning to talk nonsense,
    and you may think to yourself, 'I wish I had a song to sing.' You may only
    hold this thought for a second or so. But I heard you when you thought
    that, and that's why I wrote you this song.' --- The Independent, San
    Francisco, March 1, 2008

    Palmcorder Yajna was the first song written for We Shall All Be Healed,
    and the song that catalyzed John to write an album about his experiences
    in Portland after strumming and shouting the [Holt Boulevard](#fn:holt)
    line. It was shortly followed by Slow West Vultures and Linda Blair Was Born
    Innocent. --- VPRO session - Zeldzaam Dwars - 2004-03-27.

[^yajnasingle]:
    As mentioned [above](#related), Palmcorder Yajna was also [released as a
    single](yajna.html).

[^holt]:
    [Holt Boulevard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_Boulevard) is a
    major east-west road through the Inland Empire region of Southern
    California, turning into East Holt Avenue and then West Holt Avenue as it
    [crosses first North Garey Avenue and then North White Avenue heading
    west](http://goo.gl/maps/rKgfa).

    "I had this A -- D progression I was strumming one day, enjoying the sound
    of it. Well, I didn't have any lyrics to hand, so I start to improvise,
    which is how half my stuff gets written --- I just start playing the
    guitar, and I'll bark out a lyric or two... When I was a heroin addict, my
    dealer told me one time while he was selling us stuff, 'If you ever get
    arrested, they're gonna ask you where you got it.' And this was by way of
    saying, 'If you turn me in, I'll kill you.' 'Just tell 'em Holt Boulevard
    and they can't do anything to you. You just tell 'em you bought it on Holt
    because there's a lot of dealers on Holt.' This is in Pomona... Everything
    your dealer says, he's like Jesus Christ, so you, 'OK, got that, Holt
    Boulevard.' So, OK. So within six months, I'm handcuffed to a hospital bed
    in the ICU, and detectives from Pomona, the police department come in to
    ask me, 'Who sold you the stuff?' And I mean, I had been comatose for two
    days. But I was not so comatose that I couldn't remember... And I was
    lying there, you know, with the black activated charcoal that they put in
    you to get the drugs out caked on my nose. 'So, where'd you get it?' 'Holt
    Boulevard! Haha.' OK. So, fast-forward fifteen years, or twenty, and I'm
    no longer a heroin addict, and I have a real life now, and I'm half-assing
    my way around this autobiographical stuff, and I'm doing A, and D, and A,
    and D, and I'm thinking, 'This is going to be one of those songs where
    you're hiding what you're actually writing about.' And so I went --- and I
    was just joking with myself --- 'Holt Boulevard!' \<laughs\> That's really
    funny, right? And then I mentioned specifically where, between Garey and
    White, right, that's a location where you could walk down the street at
    some point in the 80s and maybe score. Probably not, but --- you'd go down
    to Mission for that." City Arts and Lectures, Herbst Theatre, San
    Francisco, February 24, 2009. See also the VPRO session, Zeldzaam Dwars,
    March 27, 2004.

[^travelodge]:
    [Travelodge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelodge) is a chain of cheap
    hotels throughout the United States.

[^tweaker]:
    A term for a methamphetamine user.

[^cocaine]:
    Also sung, "Send somebody out for cocaine". It's unclear to me if this
    changes the meaning of the original lyric, perhaps implying baking soda
    (used to make crack). My best guess is that the original meaning is
    intended to refer to pop drinks. --- Black Cat, Washington, DC, October
    11, 2004

## Linda Blair Was Born Innocent [^lindablair] [^lindablairjohn] ## {#lindablair}

Gentle hum of the old machines \\
Here we come, scrubbed and scoured \\
Patches on our jeans

When the drone sounds in the cool night wind \\
We pick up the call \\
Kick all the traces in

Hungry for love \\
Ready to drown \\
So tie down the sails \\
We're going downtown

Great big drain on the power grid \\
You may not like Tate's [^tate] methods \\
But you've got to admit, she's a real nice kid

We walk light down the wires \\
Higher than weather balloons \\
Empty hearts on fire

Hungry for love \\
Ready to drown \\
So tie down the sails tonight \\
We're going downtown

[^lindablair]:
    [Linda Blair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Blair) is an American
    actress most famous for her role as the possessed child Regan in the
    classic 1973 horror film *The Exorcist*. In her 20s, she struggled with
    cocaine and other substances.

    [Born Innocent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_Innocent_(film)) was a
    made-for-television film starring Linda Blair as a sexually and physically
    abused 14-year-old girl sent to prison, which she continues to be
    oppressed. The film includes a notorious scene in which Chris Parker,
    Blair's character, is raped in the showers by the other female inmates.

[^lindablairjohn]:
    "So, I set the whole next album in Pomona, California, but just between
    you and me, most of the people, or a fair number of them, are actually
    people I knew in Portland up around 13th and Taylor. And that is in fact
    is where this song takes place, but that's a secret. It is about our
    mutual friends, the tweak fiends." --- Berbati's Pan, Portland, October 3,
    2003\. See also Wow Hall, Eugene, June 21, 2005.

    "I challenged myself to not write love songs, and instead to write songs
    about junkies... I have a lot of dead friends, this is about some of
    them." --- Will's Pub, Orlando, April 9, 2003. See also Black Cat,
    Washington DC, October 11, 2004.

    "This is a song about the special times you share with the ones you love
    when the ones you love have a quarter pound of quality bathtub crank." ---
    Bottom of the Hill, June 23, 2005. See also First Unitarian Church,
    Philadelphia, May 4, 2005.

[^tate]:
    Given the song's title reference to a child actor, and the rareness of the
    name Tate, this could refer to fellow child star [Tatum
    O'Neal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatum_O%27Neal), who similarly
    became addicted to heroin and cocaine as an adult.

    AKM Adam suggested that this could instead be a reference to [Little Man
    Tate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Man_Tate), in which Jodi Foster
    plays the mother of a child prodigy. Ultimately, I'm not sure --- if you
    have some insight into this, please [reach out](../about.html#contact)!

[^belgium]:
    [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium) is a multilingual country
    in northwestern Europe.

    "The album is sort of a series of snapshots of tweakers, right, speed
    freaks, which was a very popular thing when I lived in Portland, and ---
    not the speed freaks themselves, but the speed. And speed freaks, like
    everybody else, but with a particular vengeance, talk about how they're
    gonna get the hell out of wherever they're at, right, and go to someplace
    where, you know, it's sort of like the chemical land of milk and honey.
    Where they're usually gonna go to Amsterdam, right. And I knew one who
    went to Amsterdam, and then tried to bring stuff back in his pockets,
    right, and wound up in a European jail. Ah, how can you blow it that bad?
    You know, he showed up at the airport high as a kite, and they just took
    him in. But yeah, so, Belgium is sort of my speed freak cast's, their
    Kubla Khan, you know, that they have in their mind, that they're all going
    to go to Belgium, but actually, their own personal Belgium is a sort of
    hellish place. --- KEXP session, May 21, 2004

## The Young Thousands ## {#thousands}

Boats ease into the harbor bearing real suspicious cargo \\
And the sunlight on the water sets a switch off in your brain \\
The things that you've got coming will consume you \\
There's someone waiting out there in an alley with a chain

Here they come \\
The young thousands \\
Here they come \\
The young thousands

The ghosts that haunt your building are prepared to take on substance \\
And the dull pain that you live with isn't getting any duller \\
There's a closet full of almost pristine videotape \\
Documenting sordid little scenes in living color

Here they come \\
The young thousands \\
Here they come \\
The young thousands

You drive east from the ocean with both hands tied on the wheel \\
And you go past Garden Grove [^gardengrove] as the pleasure index rises \\
The things that you've got coming will do things that you're afraid to \\
There is someone waiting out there with a mouthful of surprises [^mouthful]

The ghosts that haunt your building have been learning how to breathe \\
They scan the hallways nightly vainly searching for a sign \\
There must be diamonds somewhere in a place that stinks this bad \\
There are brighter things than diamonds coming down the line

The men were here to get your Belgian things [^belgium] \\
They'll store them for you in an airplane hangar \\
There's guys in biohazard suits, mud caking on their rubber boots \\
They've come to keep your pretty things from danger

The men were here to get your Belgian things \\
They'll spend the whole day hauling them downstairs \\
I shot a roll of thirty-two exposures [^film] \\
My camera groans beneath the weight it bears

I can see you in my sleep \\
Playing the points for all you're worth \\
Walking gingerly across \\
The bruised earth

The men were here to get your Belgian things \\
They waltzed right through the door and went fluorescent [^blacklight] \\
Their boots were black and shiny and your treasures gleamed like stars \\
Bones from deep down in the Fertile Crescent [^crescent]

The arteries are clogging in the mainframe \\
There's too much information in the pipes \\
I saw the mess you left up in the east bedroom \\
A tiger's never gonna change its stripes \\
I guess \\
I guess \\
But, Jesus, what a mess \\
One way in \\
No way out

The men were here to get your Belgian things \\
And only I was here to see them do it \\
I wish you had a number where you are [^belgianname] \\
It's hard with no one here to help me through it

I can see you in my sleep \\

[^film]:
    I used to think this was a film type, such as the Type 32 format of
    [Polaroid](http://www.rwhirled.com/landlist/landfilm.htm#P100) film,
    capable of shooting color film at an ASA 100 film speed. However, a better
    explanation was offered to me by AKM Adam, a religious scholar who has
    written extensively on the Mountain Goats:

    > Standard film rolls used to come in reels of 24 or 36 exposures;
    > evidently John shot 32 of the 36 exposures, or rolled his own film
    > (which some of us hardcore photo types used to do to save money). This
    > line bothers me mildly, because 32 exposures is not so much, even in a
    > day when the quantity of film one might use was significantly limited
    > (by limited film rolls, costs of \[film\] and developing, and so on) ---
    > but I suppose the photos he shot were burdensome.

    John has explained that he is the person handcuffed to the gurney:

    "This song is a true story, kinda, but I switched the persons, because
    I didn't want to tell some story about, 'Oh, I was suffering so much...',
    although I am now writing those songs. But I thought I would just slip in
    and change the person who is suffering to the second person. This is a
    story about how I woke up one morning and saw my friend Joel's mother...
    she's a nurse, and I was in the hospital, and I said, 'Oh, Mrs.  Huschle,
    can you get them to take off the handcuffs?' And she said, 'No, not yet.'"

    send you to a treatment facility." --- Empty Bottle, Chicago, November 15,

    There is a strong relationship between this story and John's explanation
    of the [Holt Boulevard line](#fn:holt), which are sometimes told together
    as being the same story, which they may be. See for example City Arts and
    Lectures, Herbst Theatre, February 24, 2009.

    Number Two: In the village. \\
    Prisoner: What do you want? \\
    Number Two: Information. \\

Wrap this bandana around your head \\
Don't let anyone see that you're bleeding

Fire up the scanner and keep your eyes on it \\
Don't speak unless someone speaks to you \\
Hands in your pockets and soot on your face \\
The warm love of God coursing through you

Home again \\
Home again \\
Garden Grove \\
Garden Grove

I can remember when we were in high school \\
Our dreams were like fugitive warlords \\
Plotting triumphant returns to the city \\
Keeping TEC-9s [^tec9] tucked under the floorboards \\

And cruise down these alleys for honey to feed them \\
Jellyfish riding the surf

Shoving our heads \\

    "Man, this is a wrong story to tell. Well, it is, because it --- you know
    they say, 'Persons, any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely
    coincidental' --- that's not true in the case of this story. This is true
    thing that somebody else did, so why should I hate on him, right? It's my
    friend Max. Not Max the photographer, a different guy, you've never met
    him. But he, like so many of us in those days, you know, and many young
    men and women of good will, he developed a real taste for black tar heroin
    and, but, like everybody's dealer, the dealer would go in and out of, you
    know, 'Ah, I'm getting out of this business, so you can't call me this
    weekend', and I really have a theory about --- I don't know if you know
    that dealers do this, but smack dealers are into this, it's like, really,
    like --- doing this real
    cut-you-off-turn-it-back-on-make-you-dependent-on-them thing.  Who could
    have imagined that the person dealing heroin to you would turn out to be
    an ammoral monster? It's a strange world. So, anyway our dealer is going
    through one of his periodic I'm-not-going-to-sell-to-you moments, which
    I'm just assuming means he got enough money and doesn't need anybody
    hanging around his house, right now, right, so Max drives into Orange
    County into the housing projects where he knows who can get it, but we
    don't know what to do once we get there. It's not a thing we know. And I
    say we --- I wasn't with him this day --- thank God, because he went and
    scored, and he was very excited, it worked, so he pulled over on the side
    of the 57 freeway in Orange County to fix and nod off, instead of, I guess
    his idea was fix and then get back on the freeway? But he didn't do that
    'cause he nodded out, and that's when the California Highway Patrol came
    up behind him, and asked him how he was feeling with the needle of heroin
    on the seat, and he went to jail, and so, well, then years later I think,
    'Oh man, remember that one time Max went to Garden Grove?'" --- Bowery

## All Up the Seething Coast ## {#coast}

I eat a couple Milky Ways [^milkyway] for breakfast \\
I take my coffee light and sweet \\
Show up for dinner when you tell me to \\
And I heap the sugar high and white on everything I eat

Carry an apple in my pocket \\
I write reminders on my skin \\
Clip meaningless pictures from old magazines \\
I tape them to the walls, it's a bad place I'm in

And nothing you can say or do will stop me \\
And a thousand dead friends can't stop me

I go back to places I remember \\
See what's been going on without me \\
Stare down the strangers at the bus stop \\
Pretend they've been gossiping about me

White sugar by the spoonful \\
Cantaloupes and grapes and watermelons \\
I force it down like it was medicine \\
Anybody asks, you tell 'em what you want to tell 'em

But the best you've got is powerless against me \\
And all your little schemes break when they come crashing up against me \\
Ah

## Quito [^quitojohn] [^quito] ## {#quito}

When I receive the blessing I've got coming \\
I'm going to raise a nice cold glass of water \\
And toast the living and the dead \\
Who've gone before me and my head \\
Will throb like an old wound reopening

When I get off the bus down there my children \\
They all are going to greet me at the station \\
Like gypsies they will dance around me and \\
The choral droning sounds their voices make will \\
Saturate the evening

When I get off the wheel I'm going to stop \\
And make amends to everyone I've wounded \\
And when I wave my magic wand \\
Those few who've slipped the surly bonds [^highflight] \\
Will rise like salmon at the spawning

    Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth \\
    And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings; \\
    Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth \\
    of sun-split clouds, --- and done a hundred things \\
    You have not dreamed of --- wheeled and soared and swung \\
    High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there, \\
    I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung \\
    My eager craft through footless halls of air...

    Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue \\
    I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace \\
    Where never lark nor ever eagle flew --- \\
    And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod \\
    The high untrespassed sanctity of space, \\
    Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.

    Magee's poem was itself inspired by lines from several other poems.

You didn't know that I was watching \\
Now you know \\
Let it all go \\

    "This is a song about things that you infuse too much of yourself into so
    that when you have to see them destroyed, or forget where they went, it

[^desk]:
    "Sometimes I change up a lyric in the second verse... The desk in it is a
    real desk... the desk is this beautiful, beautiful wooden desk my father
    --- not my stepfather, I always want to make this distinction --- my
    father is the kind of guy who, if he's going to buy a new desk, he goes
    and looks at the desk over and over, and he discusses it, and he measures
    it, he goes home and looks at where it might fit, and he looks at some
    other desks, asks the guy a lot of questions... I'm a speed freak, this
    used to drive me nuts as a kid. It's like, 'You want the desk?  Just buy
    the desk.  If you don't like it, we'll take it in the backyard and chop it
    up, it'll be great.' So --- but he always would hold out for six to eight
    or nine months before getting some desk --- and I got the desk when I
    moved to Portland for my catastrophic year there... So I had this desk,
    that had belonged to my father, right, and when I was a child I would
    watch him working at it and sort of look up with that idolatrous look that
    a son looks up at his father with --- this is my busy, smart dad, hope
    someday I'm like him and inside of like, two weeks of being in possession
    of the desk, I'm storing burnt spoons and needles in the upper drawer and
    feeling that really transgressive --- it's like, 'I feel bad about that,
    but there's really no better place to put them, so.' Anyway, I was in
    Portland and I thought, 'I know he doesn't have this desk anymore, I've
    visted him where he lives and I remember he did put it in storage', and I
    thought, 'Man, this desk is haunting a building around here someplace, and
    if this was a videogame and I had endless lives I would find the building
    that has the desk and there would be an awesome cutscene where I talk to
    it." --- Swedish-American Hall, San Francisco, June 27, 2012

## Against Pollution [^pollutionjohn] [^lusseyran] [^pollutionseries] ## {#pollution}

And a guy came in \\
Tried to kill me, so I shot him in the face \\
I would do it again, I would do it again

When the last days come \\
We shall see visions \\
More vivid than sunsets \\

We will recognize each other \\
And see ourselves for the first time \\

[^pollutionjohn]:
    "While a lot of these are drawn from experience, I did not, in fact, ever
    shoot anybody... The guy is carrying a terrible guilt that somebody came
    into the store where he was working and he sort of --- he's working a
    liquor store on the night shift, he's not really got a lot going on ---
    and some guy comes in and tries to rob the place, and he shoots and kills
    him, right. That'd be a heavy burden to carry, I think, unless you were
    one of those shallow people who'd go, 'Well, I did what I had to do.' But
    I suspect for most of us in the depths of our hearts that would be a very
    hard thing to have done. And so the guy is sort of musing on this one very
    real experience versus, you know, its importance in the long run, and he's
    thinking a little about God, and he's thinking about redemption... it kind
    of is the key song as far as the album's title goes." --- WXDU session,
    February 1, 2004

[^lusseyran]:
    This title is eerily similar to the title of [Jacques
    Lusseyran's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lusseyran) collection
    of essays, *Against the Pollution of the I*. Lusseyran was a blind man and
    a hero of the French resistance against the Nazis due to his formation of
    the Volontaires de la Liberté, who produced propagandha against Hitler and
    sheltered Allied soldiers evading capture. He was only 17. Lusseyran was
    betrayed and sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp until his
    liberation in 1945. His autobiography, *And There Was Light*, remains a
    celebrated work about the French resistance and is notable for his
    optimism and unquenchable spirit.

    Thank you (again!) to Mairead Beeson for noticing this connection.

[^pollutionseries]:
    Against Pollution is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^hardy]:
    There is significant overlap between both the tone and phrasing of this
    song, particularly here, and [Thomas
    Hardy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy) 1902 poem, [The Man
    He Killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_He_Killed), in which a
    man shoots his foe "face to face". In the poem, the narrator contemplates
    and then justifies the killing, similar to in this song. This allusion is
    far from clear and although John is fond of these sorts of oblique
    references, I certainly can't prove it. Here is the poem in full so you
    may judge for yourself:

    > "Had he and I but met \\
    > By some old ancient inn, \\
    > We should have sat us down to wet \\
    > Right many a nipperkin!

[^scripture]:
    John has sometimes sung Biblically-alluded lyrics or quotes from scripture
    here. See 40 Watt Club, Athens, Georgia, August 10, 2006.

[^revelations]:
    An allusion to the [Christian end
    times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_eschatology), in which the
    dead will be resurrected and all people will be judged by God.

[^acts217]:
    An allusion to [Acts
    2:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A17&version=HCSB):

    And it will be in the last days, says God, \\
    that I will pour out My Spirit on all humanity; \\
    then your sons and your daughters will prophesy, \\
    your young men will see visions, \\
    and your old men will dream dreams.

[^seeourselves]:
    This phrase is similar to lines in [New World Emerging
    Blues](australia.html#newworld), however, it's unclear to me if they have
    a shared origin somewhere. Given the [frequent references to Corinthians
    elsewhere](series.html#bible), and the similar imagery, it's possible
    that this draws from [1 Corinthians
    13:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13%3A12&version=HCSB),
    although the allusion is not as obvious as in other instances:

    > For now we see indistinctly, as in a mirror, \\
    > but then face to face. \\
    > Now I know in part, \\
    > but then I will know fully, \\
    > as I am fully known.

    AKM Adam, a theologian and author of a paper describing the Mountain
    Goats' usage of scripture, supports this thesis (personal correspondence,
    July 2014).

## Pigs That Ran Straightaway into the Water, Triumph Of [^pigsseries] ## {#pigs}

*"The story of the pigs who ran straightaway into the water, and their great
triumph."* [^gerasene]

*"Woo!"*

You're gonna send me back to where I came from \\
Please don't send me back to where I came from \\
Let me go \\
Where the white magnolias grow

You're gonna fit me for that orange jumpsuit \\
Please don't fit me for that orange jumpsuit \\
Let me ride \\
Where the dragonflies glide

Yeah, but you're going to do \\
What you want to do \\
No matter what \\
I ask of you \\
You think you hold the high hand \\
I've got my doubts \\
I come from Chino [^chino] where the asphalt sprouts

Big bus headed southeast from the courthouse \\
But I'm not headed southeast from the courthouse \\
Let some mysterious chunk of space debris \\
Puncture the roof and set me free

And even if I have to go to Claremont [^claremont] \\
Well I guess I'll just have to go to Claremont \\
Let me go \\
Let me lie low

Yeah, but you're going to do \\
What you want to do \\
No matter what \\
I ask of you \\
And you send your dark messengers \\
To tempt me \\
I come from Chino so all your threats are empty

[^pigsseries]:
    Pigs That Ran Straightaway into the Water, Triumph Of is part of the
    [informal series of Biblical references](series.html#bible)

[^gerasene]:
    This refers to the [Exorcism of the
    Gerasene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism_of_the_Gerasene_demoniac),
    a miracle of Jesus told in the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke, in
    which Jesus casts the demons Legion out of the body of a man. At the
    demons' request, they enter a herd of two thousand pigs, who drown
    themselves in a nearby lake.

[^chino]:
    [Chino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chino,_California) is an Inland
    Empire city near Claremont, Southern California. Potentially relevant to
    the song, it is home to three prisons, one for men, one for women, and one
    for youth. Chino is the childhood home of Peter Peter Hughes.

[^claremont]:
    [Claremont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claremont,_California) is a city
    in the Inland Empire of Southern California where much of the album's
    action takes place. John attended college here at Pitzer, one of the five
    Claremont Colleges. See also [this footnote](#fn:wsabhjohn).
