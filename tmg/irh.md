[^isopanisad]:
    The Isha Upanishad, sometimes transliterated [Śrī
    Īśopaniṣad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isha_Upanishad), is a Hindu holy
    text dating roughly to before the current calendar era. It is one of the
    Upanishads, texts which form the core philosophical foundation of
    Hinduism. The Isha Upanishad attempts to describe the nature of Ish, the
    supreme being, in theistic Hinduism.

## Abide With Me [^abideseries] [^abidewithme] ## {#abide}

Abide with me, fast falls the eventide [^eventide] \\
The darkness deepens, Lord, with me abide  \\
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee \\
Help of the helpless, Lord abide with me

Swift to its close, ebbs out life's little day \\
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away \\
Change and decay in all around I see \\
O thou who changest not, abide with me

[^abideseries]:
    Abide With Me is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible) and the [informal series of cover
    songs](series.html#covers).

[^abidewithme]:
    [Abide With Me][abidewiki] is a hymn written by Henry Francis Lyte in
    1847, just three weeks before he died of tuberculosis. It is most
    frequently sung (as in this case) to William Monk's tune "Eventide". John
    sings just the first two verses of the original eight.

[abidewiki]:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abide_With_Me_(hymn)

[^eventide]:
    These first two lines allude to [Luke 24:29][luke2429], "But they urged
    Him: 'Stay with us, because it's almost evening, and now the day is almost
    over.' So He went in to stay with them." Holman Christian Standard Bible,
    retrieved July 3, 2013.

## Born Ready [^readyjohn] ## {#ready}

I'm going to see you in San Jose [^sanjose] \\
I'm going to see you in San Jose \\
And I'm going to take you out for good \\
I'm going to take you down

I'm headed up the 101 [^route101] right now \\
I'm headed up the 101 right now \\
And there's snow on the ground in Ohio today \\
There's no snow here

The sun is in my eyes \\
Yeah the sun is in my eyes \\
When I think about you, I feel so bad \\
It's been a long, long, long, long time

[^readyjohn]:
    When played at Cat's Cradle, Carrboro, on January 27, 1999, John called
    this song "Know the Way".

[^sanjose]:
    [San Jose][sanjosewiki] is the largest city in Northern California, and the
    third-largest of the state.

[sanjosewiki]:      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California

[^route101]:
    [Route 101][route101wiki] is a major highway in the USA running along the
    West Coast. If the narrator is 'headed up', they are presumably in
    California moving north to San Jose. Use of the definite article in front
    of the freeway number ("the 101") is common in Southern Californian
    dialects, possibly a reflection of John's own Southern Californian
    origins, the origins of the person in the song, or the person's location.
    (For more information, see for example Dodson, Stephen (2008), ["The" +
    Freeway](http://www.languagehat.com/archives/003203.php), retrieved July
    3, 2013).

## Cobscook Bay [^cobscookjohn] [^cobscookbay] ## {#cobscook}

We're alone most of the time these days \\
Jill used to come by, but she went away \\
And Gail used to come around and trash the joint \\
But she moved off to Dana Point [^danapoint] \\
And you went along, just for the ride \\
And you both committed suicide

And day is breaking over Cobscook Bay \\
And I've never seen anything like it in my life

Cow gave birth and her calves are snow white \\
They huddle up close together at night \\
And the mama cow leans down and cleans her young \\
Licking their faces with her tongue \\
And unmarked airplanes buzz the air \\
And you're falling off that cliff somewhere in California \\
Which I've never seen \\
I put the pieces all together, but I don't know what they mean

And day is breaking over Cobscook Bay \\
And I've never seen anything like it in my life

[^cobscookjohn]:
    "This song is not unique, but is one of a group of songs where I look at
    it and I have no idea what I was talking about --- where that story came
    from, what it was driving at, who those people are, and why they had to
    die." --- Zoop, Farm Sanctuary, June 17, 2007

[^cobscookbay]:
    [Cobscook Bay][cobscookwiki] is located in Washington County, in the US
    state of Maine.

[cobscookwiki]:     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobscook_Bay

[^danapoint]:
    [Dana Point][danapointwiki] is a city in Southern California, presumably
    home of the same "cliff somewhere" referenced later.

## Dutch Orchestra Blues [^dutchseries] ## {#dutch}

Somewhere in secret \\
The Dutch orchestra's [^orchestra] playing \\
Somewhere in secret \\
The Dutch orchestra's playing \\
Real nice \\
Real nice

And they play so quiet \\
You can hear the passing traffic \\
They play so quiet \\
You can hear the passing traffic \\
And the cars buzz by \\
And the wind blows \\
And I may walk past, and I may not \\
And someone may notice, or it may all slide right by \\
And you may love me, or you may not love me at all anymore \\
But the sun will shine on Holland in the spring \\
And God will watch over the members of the orchestra for me \\
With all his available energies \\
Yeah, yeah

[^dutchseries]:
    Dutch Orchestra Blues is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^orchestra]:
    Though John does very clearly use the definite article "the", there are a
    number of [Dutch orchestras][orchestraswiki] to which he may be referring,
    or another one entirely - it is (probably deliberately) left ambiguous.

## Pseudothyrum [^pseudothyrum] Song [^pseudothyrumjohn] ## {#pseudothyrum}

Why do you treat me this way? \\
And why do you try so hard to break my spirit? \\
I think someone was mean to you when you were little \\
That's what I think \\
I think someone was mean to you

Why do you cling to such petty points of contention? \\
And why don't you allow me one or two small victories now and then? \\
I think someone was mean to you when you didn't deserve it \\
That's what I think \\
I think someone was mean to you

But I \\
I am not that guy \\
Can you get that straight? \\
I am a completely different person \\
From the one you have in mind

Why do you stand by the things you say \\
Long after you don't mean to hurt anybody anymore? \\
I think someone was mean to you \\
For a long, long time, that's what I think \\
I think someone was mean to you

[^pseudothyrum]:
    "Pseudothyrum" appears to be an extremely obscure Latin word meaning
    "[secret door][pseudothyrumwiktionary]".

[^pseudothyrumjohn]:
    "This, for reasons that are alien to even me, is called Pseudothyrum
    Song." --- CBGB, New York, July 27, 1999

## The Last Limit of Bhakti [^bhakti] ## {#bhakti}

Two, three, four

Let me serve you with my mind \\
Let me serve you with my mind \\
Let me leave this grieving sand and sky far behind

Let me serve you with my tongue \\
Let me serve you with my tongue \\
Let me say your name all day 'til my mouth goes numb

When the sun comes up \\
Open up the blind \\
Let me hear the machines grate gears, squeal and grind, yeah

Let me serve you 'til it's over \\
Let me serve you 'til it's all over \\
When the world is giving your secrets all away \\
Let me give you cover

Let me serve you with my body \\
Let me serve you with my body \\
Let me fight now until the end of time \\
The last limit \\
Yeah, yeah

[^bhakti]:
    In Hinduism and Buddhism, [Bhakti][bhaktiwiki] refers to religious
    devotion in the form of worship of the divine. Within monotheistic
    Hinduism, it is the love felt by the worshipper towards their personal
    God.
