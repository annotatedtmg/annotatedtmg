# Series #

Many Mountain Goats songs belong in series linked together by naming
conventions and common themes. Cataloguing all of these is a massive task, and
it's hard to know how complete this is. However, since a large amount of
commentary exists regarding these, rather than attempting to cover all of it in
the footnotes for each song in a series, I will document series-specific
information here and link to this page in the annotations.

For the sake of this document, I have created two types of series. "Formal
series" are those acknowledged by John Darnielle and by the fan community.
"Informal series" are recognized recurring themes and naming conventions which
lack the intentional cohesiveness found in the formal series.

Along with these series are listed outtakes and extras. This category
documents songs which were originally intended for a particular release but
which ultimately were not included, either being released as bonus tracks
(extras) or in another fashion (outtakes).

Please [let me know](../about.html#contact) if you see any errors or
omissions, or if I've included something you think doesn't belong; I'd love to
hear from you and make this as complete as possible.

# Formal series # {#formal}

## Alpha couple ## {#alpha}

This is arguably the canonical Mountain Goats series, with numerous songs
written about them and the source of endless arguments about the exact
chronology of the songs depicting the almost-divorcing couple. The series
predates John as a musician, beginning as a collection of poems, one of which
eventually became the Extra Glenns song Twelve Hands High. [^alphapoem] John
chose the Alpha suffix as a way of keeping track of the songs, as in Latin the
*a-* prefix designates negation (known as a [privative
alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privative_a)). The first tracks were
accordingly grouped in a set called *Songs from Point Alpha Privative*.
[^alphaprivative] The songs are, unless otherwise specified, intended to be
sung by either member of the couple. [^genderneutral]

The Alpha Couple are a Catholic [^catholic] man and woman from Southern
California whose relationship survives solely on the love they want to have for
each other, the hatred they actually share, and the alcohol they imbibe to
quash their feelings. John has indicated that the couple was originally
intended to get a divorce, but as he wrote the songs, this didn't wind up
happening. [^divorce] Thinking everything will improve if they move, they leave
California (after potentially staying in Portland), drink for a year in a motel
in Nevada, and stay at least for a time at the Stardust casino on the strip.
[^stardust] They move and finally settle in Tallahassee, Florida, after the
Alpha wife gets pregnant, although it's unclear if they ever have children.
[^pregnant] The specific trajectory of Southern California, then Nevada, and
finally Florida was chosen as it depicts them "crawl\[ing\] along the bottom of
the country" until there's nowhere farther to reach, symbolically living off
the lowest scraps of the country. [^alphaorigins] The impoverished part of
Tallahassee that they ultimately settle in was chosen for the availability of
cheap alcohol, cheap land, sense of decay and rot, and because their alcoholism
and unemployment would prevent them living anywhere else. [^alphaorigins]

The entirety of the [album Tallahassee](tallahassee.html) is about this couple;
much more information is contained there and in [its
annotations](tallahassee.html#footnotes). Also related to the couple is the
[See America Right](america.html) single, released in anticipation of
Tallahassee.

The following songs are generally considered to be Alpha couple songs.

    [Taking the Dative liner notes](dative.html#liner). This became the likely
    origin of the title Star Dusting.

    The Taking the Dative liner notes are a little inconsistent with the
    general story, describing (in my reading) them paying for some kind of
    transportation to Florida rather than driving, living in Portland, and the
    Alpha wife getting pregnant. It's not clear to me how reliable these
    additions are.

[^pregnant]:
    [Taking the Dative liner notes](dative.html#liner). Regarding whether or
    not they have children, Letter from a Motel claims that they have three
    daughters, but that's not particularly consistent with other aspects of the
    series, such as No Children.

It is unclear to me whether [Alphabetizing](chile.html#alphabetizing) and
[Ending the Alphabet](hafg.html#alphabet) are for certain Alpha couple songs. I
have included them given their titles in the absence of other information.

An unnamed song that [was renamed Alpha Compunction by
Nall](http://www.mountain-goats.com/forums/read.php?2,25263,26439#msg-26439)
exists somewhere, but as I've never found a copy it is not listed above.

## Going to ... ## {#goingto}

As [Nall describes](http://www.themountaingoats.net/faq.html), the Going to
... series describe the feeling of trying to improve your life by traveling to
somewhere else, often only finding the same thing there that you had fled.
John described in 1997 that there are no main characters, and that the songs
are only very loosely thematically connected. [^nomain]

## Jenny ## {#jenny}

A series easily taken literally that perhaps oughtn't, debates about which
songs feature Jenny have been ongoing for years. In 2017, John began
discussing the series in more detail. She may or may not be the same person in
each song; either way, she represents "a function of memory" --- someone who
is "defined by \[her\] absence", but whose recollection causes an overwhelming
flood of deep feelings long held under. Accordingly she is not generally
present, either physically or emotionally, during good times; she is "an
emblem of more difficult times... of wilder times, but also times that they're
pretty clearly romanticizing". [^jenny]

## Orange Ball of ... ## {#orangeball}

This series arose to make fun of Don DeLillo's repeated use of the phrase
"orange ball" in [White
Noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Noise_(novel)). [^2005-07-02] After
it became a series rather than a one-off joke, John has mentioned that it has
neither specific repeated characters nor any solid connections beween them.
[^orangekjhk]

[^2005-07-02]:
    "I'll tell you why I wrote this song, it was to make fun of Don DeLillo.
    Because the sun was an orange ball in about like five different instances
    in the space of fifty pages. I really like his writing, but I thought that
    was lazy. And so being an arrogant college student, I thought, I'll really
    get him, I'll write some song about him and my obscure little indie rock
    band will play it, and then, then we'll see who's funny.  Thus was the
    Orange Ball series born." --- July 2, 2005, Old American Can Factory,
    Brooklyn. See also Letters to Santa, Chicago, December 7, 2011.

## Pure ... ## {#pure}

Like the Orange Ball of ... and Going to ... series, John has stated that
these are mostly unrelated. The Pure ... songs are described as being "kind of
intently focused in \[a\] way that I think I don't force myself to be on the
other ones... more immediate". [^pureorigins]

## Song for ... ## {#songfor}

I have been unable to find anything where John describes this series (if you
know of something, please [contact me](../about.html#contact)). However, based
on the titles, it seems that these are songs dedicated to specific individuals
or things.

As the Songs About ... titles seem to be in the same vein, these are included
as well. Brave, which is a Chris Knox cover, is included by virtue of being
released on an album titled Stroke: Songs for Chris Knox; Golden Boy is
included due to originally being released on an Inland Empire compilation
album called Object Lessons: Songs About Products. Both to me seem to fall
under the general feel of the Song for ... series.

A song called Song for Mitch Williams [has been
reported](http://www.mountain-goats.com/forums/read.php?2,26191,26194), but as
it's unlikely to ever surface it isn't included in the above list. Also, [Nall
reports](http://www.themountaingoats.net/cgi-bin/songs.cgi?ACTION=show_song&SONGID=278)
that Saigon Shrunken Panorama was once called Saigon: Song for Anonymity, but
I've never been able to confirm that. A song titled Song for Denise Matthews
was recorded for All Eternals Deck, but did not make the album and has never
been released. [^denisematthews]

## Standard Bitter Love Songs ## {#sbls}

Again, I unfortunately have not heard John discussing these songs, however,
one possible unifying theme could come from simply taking their names at face
value.

# Informal series # {#informal}

As decribed above, these series are less explicit and, while tied together
through naming conventions and themes, are not as obviously part of a series
as those listed above.

## Aztec songs ## {#aztec}

Nall's catalog includes a [series for Quetzalcoatl ...
songs](http://www.themountaingoats.net/cgi-bin/songs.cgi?ACTION=show_series&SERIES=6),
which follow an obvious naming convention. However, it seems to me that these
fall under a more general pattern of songs which are named using Nahuatl, the
Aztec language. I have not found anything where John discusses this series; if
you know of something, please [contact me](../about.html#contact).

## Biblical songs ## {#bible}

John has made many songs based off of mythological or religious figures,
including Aztecs, Satanists, Rastafarians, and others. However, more so than
others, many songs by John have Biblical references. Many of these references
are in the song titles, some are quoting scripture, and some are referencing
particular Biblical figures or narratives, even attracting the attention of
religious scholars. [^adam2011] While cataloguing all songs that make any
mention of religion would be prohibitive and unnecessarily speculative, this
category includes all songs which explicitly reference the Bible. Several
releases themselves fall into this latter category; these are listed at the
beginning.

It is unknown which version of the Bible John prefers, although I would expect
it would be a Catholic text given his personal faith. In one interview, John
mentions using the Bible Gateway website and the Holman Christian Standard
Bible translations,[^pitchfork2009] accordingly, this is where Biblical
references are drawn from on this website unless other translations make more
sense. He's also expressed his fondness for the New Jerusalem Bible,[^njb]
Young's Literal Translation,[^pitchfork2009] and the King James Version (at
least, for the Psalms[^njb]). If you have more information on preferred
translations, I would love to [hear from you](../about.html#contact).

It is debatable whether songs referencing demons or devils are Biblical in
nature. Devils and demons appear in both Christian and non-Christian
mythology. My criteria is as follows: all references to "the Devil" or "Satan"
are considered to be potentially Biblical and are thus accounted for here,
whereas all others are not listed unless John has specified otherwise --- in
this case, John's description determines the classification. However, this is
imperfect for a number of reasons, so please bear with the complexity and
recognize that these songs are not necessarily definitively Biblical while
songs not included are not necessarily non-Biblical. Accordingly, Beat the
Devil is listed below, but Devil in the Shortwave is not, since the definite
article is not used and so a singular conception of Satan cannot be confirmed.
Similarly, references to historical cities which play major Biblical roles are
sometimes difficult to categorize. In these cases, if the reference is
commonly in reference to Christianity, such as with Babylon, they are listed
here. Lastly, references to God are included if Christian influences seem
reasonable, which is frequent given John's Catholicism. References to Jesus or
God as expletives are not included.

Release and year are abbreviated and merged together due to space constraints.
References contained in liner notes are listed under the release name.

    Interpretation* 19: 109 -- 128.

    My personal feeling is that this paper makes some speculative arguments
    about the predictability of John's Biblical references and about the
    stories in the songs he mentions, but some songs nonetheless have good
    analyses and the paper has good citations, making it worth the read.

## Black Sabbath songs ## {#sabbath}

Although metal themes permeate John's work (and of course, [Last Plane to
Jakarta](http://lastplanetojakarta.com/)), Black Sabbath has received
particular attention. John has explained that there many of these songs but
that they are unlikely to have a release dedicated to them, although the
online-only Marsh Witch Visions release eventually compiled 4 new songs and 1
demo in 2017 (not covered here given its release date).[^sabbath] Although
some of these songs simply mention Black Sabbath, many others are explorations
of psyches of members of the band or descriptions of pivotal events related to
the band.

## Demos and alternate versions ## {#demos}

Demos are preparatory versions of released songs; alternate takes are exactly
what they sound like, differing from demos in not being rough cuts of more
polished studio or boombox tracks. These are related to but distinct from the
[outtakes and extras](#outtakes) listed below in that they are versions of
released songs. In other words, every song in this series is a variation on
some primary version of the song; outtakes and extras are not.

Many songs not considered to be demos (and thus not listed here) are in demo
form, meaning that they are are informally recorded without a studio and may
have been intended for a studio version they never achieved. However, as there
is no actual studio release I consider these songs to be the main release and
therefore not a demo in the sense meant here. Otherwise, half the catalog
could be called a demo! At least one song has two demo versions released
without a studio release; I consider the main release to be not a demo and the
other to be an alternate demo.

## Outtakes and extras ## {#outtakes}

Outtakes are defined here as being songs originally intended for a release but
then ultimately being distributed elsewhere, whether or not they found their
way on to a formal release (thus, in my schema, you can have an unreleased
outtake or a released outtake). Extras are songs not intended for the main
release but which were released in association with the release (for example,
on a foreign release, demo, or reissue).
