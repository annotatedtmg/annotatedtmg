### Release notes ### {#notes}

After having to cancel the 2008 Australian tour for medical reasons,
[^cancellation] John released these songs on the forums as an apology and
thank you. [^post]

The Seven for Australia moniker comes from the metadata in the files. John
similarly categorized all seven tracks in the genre "Gospel & Religious".

[^cancellation]:
    "As some Australian ticketholders have already heard, we have had to
    cancel the Australian tour. This is really devastating for us to do.
    Everybody knows I don't cancel a show unless I absolutely have to; what's
    worse, coming to Australia is the highlight of our year. So many of our
    favorite shows ever are from our Australian tours, and we were excited
    about showing everyone the full-band lineup. The note sent out by our
    wonderful Australian agents, Handsome Tours, says "for personal medical
    reasons," and that says as much as need be said; if it weren't serious, I
    would be leaving for Oz next week, believe me. You'll be doing me a great
    favor if you keep me in your thoughts and prayers, and if you know in your
    heart that I don't play around in doing right by the people I love: I will
    be back to make this up to you.

    "Thank you for your understanding and again I am really really sorry. Love
    to you all

    "John D."

    So, I wish there were a way of giving these to just you guys, 'cause
    that's who they're for, but there isn't so you're going to have to share.
    I combed through the stuff I have that's on two of the computers in this
    house and I got seven demos for you. One or two of them haven't been
    released in any form I think. I don't know though. I don't keep such good
    track of what has or hasn't been released. Anyhow, these are just my way
    of saying how sorry I did not get to see you this month. It was going to
    be an awesome tour. It will still be awesome when we get back. Til then
    please accept these!

    Dudes who like to crosspost stuff from this forum to another/on your
    lj/etc etc, I wish you wouldn't, I can't stop you, there I've said my
    piece. On the other hand! These are AACs. If you ain't got iTunes, you
    won't be able to hear them. Somebody on this thread is gonna have to
    convert the files to mp3 for repost here at some point I'd guess. That's
    on you-all OK? Finally, I hope I correctly matched the links to the song
    titles - I was uploading songs one after another and I might have gotten
    some mixed up. the descriptions should make it easy enough - acceptable
    damages sutra should have an electric guitar with a "shame shame" chorus,
    "going invisible" should being "when I rose from a heavy sleep," the rest
    you probably know in one form or another.

## New World Emerging Blues [^newworldjohn] [^newworldseries] ## {#newworld}

Someday, someday, Mount Fuji's gonna blow [^fuji] \\
Someday, someday, Mount Fuji's gonna blow \\
And spray hot ashes on \\
The villagers below

Someday, someday, the ocean's gonna rise \\
Someday, someday, the ocean's gonna rise \\
And I will emerge from hiding \\
And shrug off my disguise

Someday, someday, the Earth will be as black as tar \\
Someday, someday, the Earth will be as black as tar \\
And we will see each other \\
As we truly are [^trulyare]

    "from the we shall all be healed writing 'sessions' i.e. the period of
    time spanning from the first good song I wrote for the album to the last.
    I think we had a studio version of this too. I know we played it live a
    bit while touring europe especially and I have also done it on some radio
    sessions. this is the only one of this bunch recorded in iowa you can hear
    cicadas outside our old window at the beginning." --- [What's Up You

[^newworldseries]:
    New World Emerging Blues is part of the [informal series of
    outtakes](series.html#outtakes) and [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^fuji]:
    [Mount Fuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji) is an active
    volcano and the largest mountain in Japan.

[^trulyare]:
    This phrase is similar to lines in [Against
    Pollution](wsabh.html#pollution), however, it's unclear to me if they have
    a shared origin somewhere. Given the [frequent references to Corinthians
    elsewhere](series.html#bible), and the similar imagery, it's possible
    that this draws from [1 Corinthians
    13:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13%3A12&version=HCSB),
    although the allusion is not as obvious as in other instances:

    > For now we see indistinctly, as in a mirror, \\
    > but then face to face. \\
    > Now I know in part, \\
    > but then I will know fully, \\
    > as I am fully known.

    AKM Adam, a theologian and author of a paper describing the Mountain
    Goats' usage of scripture, supports this thesis (personal correspondence,
    July 2014).

## Going Invisible [^invisiblejohn] [^invisibleseries] ## {#invisible}

*"Two, three, four."*

When I rose from a heavy sleep \\
I was stepping lightly \\
And I put on my gray suit \\
And a matching fedora \\
Ready to face the world \\
Fairly nearly ready \\
Came down the hallway \\
Looked in the mirror \\
I'm gonna break something \\
I'm gonna break something \\
Today \\
And sweep all the pieces away

And I stood before the mirror then \\
Like I was waiting for a phone call \\
Squinting like a lost traveler in a thick fog \\
But nothing clear came into view \\
Except for you \\
Just off in the distant horizon \\
Something hidden in your hand \\
I'm gonna break something \\
I'm gonna break something \\
Today \\
And sweep all the pieces away

So I pulled my hat brim \\
Down over my eyes \\
And preened and posed and tried my \\
New self on for size

Then I was out the door \\
In the faint winter sunlight \\
Just a number in the crowd \\
Smiling at everyone \\
Ah, but who'd smile back \\
At a face like that \\
I'm gonna break something \\
I'm gonna break something \\
Today \\
And sweep all the pieces away

[^invisiblejohn]:
    "I don't think this song has been heard outside of base camp but I could
    be wrong - I always forget which songs we put on the Japanese edition of
    get lonely. at any rate this was one of my favorite songs from the get
    lonely demos. we had a version in the studio but it just didn't fit in -
    didn't quite nail it I think. happy to share this because really I think
    this song is right near the center of what that album was about and it is
    a personal favorite." --- [What's Up You

## Acceptable Damages Sutra [^sutrajohn] [^sutra] ## {#sutra}

I had some high hopes, had some high hopes \\
For the coming year \\
But as it turns out \\
Nothing ever really changes here \\
But when I've had \\
About as much as I can take \\
When I feel myself \\
Just about to break \\
I lean into the wind \\
And like an infant I reach out for your hand \\
Fool me once, you know \\
Shame, shame \\
Shame, shame [^fool]

And as we rehearse our scene \\
We really put our hearts into it \\
And I feel an opening to wiggle through \\
But I don't want to do it \\
But some habits are hard to break, hard to break \\
And some aren't really habits anymore \\
And when the full force of the hurricane \\
Nearly knocks me on the floor \\
I lean into the wind \\
And like an infant I reach out for your hand \\
Fool me once, you know \\
Shame, shame \\
Shame, shame
