### Release notes ### {#notes}

In December 2008, John's friend Mike was attacked, resulting in the potential
loss of his eye. John posted to the forums asking for some donations to help
pay Mike's medical bills, and released these three songs as a thank you for
the community's support. [^origpost] [^responsepost] If you can, [donate to
Farm Sanctuary or Ice Hockey in Harlem][mike] as John requests before
obtaining these songs.

As John states, all three of these songs likely predate Sweden, dating them to
at least 1995.

    Original post to the forums:

    Hi you guys. My friend Mike (you tMG people may know him from the "color
    in your cheeks" iowa city trance remix) was at an ATM in Fort Dodge when
    some guys demanded his wallet. Had Mike asked them for a lifeline and
    called me, I'd have told him to give them his wallet, but he didn't, and
    he got stomped real bad and has a detached retina and a broken hand. If he
    can't get surgery, he's going to lose the use of his right eye. He's also
    off work until the hand heals.

    His friend and co-blogger Jeromy has a post about it here:

    [iowaliberal.com](http://iowaliberal.com/?p=2262)

    Anybody who wants to give me a Christmas present, please help out my
    friend, that would be the best present I could get. Just to personally
    testify: I don't make a lot of friends. I have a hard time feeling
    comfortable around people. I met Mike when I was working in Ames and it
    was one of those "God, I thought I was never going to meet anybody I could
    get along with again" situations for me. Anybody who can relate to what
    I'm talking about will know how I feel when my friend could lose his eye.

    Crossposting this at the band board - I'm abroad now but obviously
    there'll be some kind of small token "thanks guys" if my people come
    across, probably in the form of some old song.

    FYI yes I will still end up putting up the "give to Farm Sanctuary this
    Xmas" post, I can't help myself OK.

    Thanks everybody.

    After many other posts from forum denizens posting condolences and
    donations, this was followed up with a thank you and a link to this page:

    Three for Mike G

    Given in gratitude for those who helped out my friend in his time of need;
    extend to all others freely with the gentle urging that in response to
    having received freely, they give in like manner - original thread
    [here](http://www.mountain-goats.com/forums/read.php?2,47538,page=1), but
    there is no shortage of need in the world - think also of throwing five
    bucks at some awesome [animals](http://farmsanctuary.org/) or some [truly
    kick-ass people doing truly kick-ass things for young men and
    women](http://icehockeyinharlem.org/). Go look at those links while the
    files are downloading! Paypal somebody a fin! You'll never miss the five
    bucks and it will totally make your day! OK done talking now, go listen to
    ridiculously old (probably pre-*Sweden*) songs and laugh at the
    ultra-nasality! Kiss baby Mithras as you pass his manger! all love all day
    long for all time

## Hye Kye [^hyekye] ## {#hyekye}

In December in California, the air was hot \\
And I carried the Christmas tree down Indian Hill [^indianhill] \\
To the Gemco parking lot [^gemco] \\
What did I see \\
What spectacle confronted me \\
Ten thousand Christmas trees [^treelot]

And the people standing around, and the smiles on their faces \\
And the boards in the shapes of Xs \\
Hammered into the Christmas trees' bases \\
I took in the smell \\
I looked around \\
And among ten thousand Christmas trees \\
I laid down

[^hyekye]:
    I have been unable to decipher this phrase. If you know what Hye Kye
    means, please [email me](../about.html#contact).

[^indianhill]:
    Indian Hill also appears in [From TG&Y](online.html#fromtgny). Given this
    and the appearance of a Gemco store, my best guess is that this refers to
    Indian Hill Boulevard, a major road through Pomona and Claremont, Southern
    California.

[^gemco]:
    [Gemco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemco) was a chain of department
    stores primarily based in Southern California until closing in the
    mid-1980s.

[^treelot]:
    My best guess is that this refers to the common American sight of
    Christmas tree lots in parking lots during November and December.

## Extreme South \#1 ## {#south}

In the little house \\
On the beach \\
Underneath \\
The dwarf peach tree \\
I've got \\
Coca-Cola \\
On my tongue \\
Yeah, sweet taste in my mouth \\
Borne down \\
Past Venezuela \\
Extreme south

South American red-capped woodpecker [^woodpecker] \\
In the high trees drumming \\
In the wet sand \\
I see you coming \\
Comfort burning \\
In your eyes \\
Yeah, sweet taste in my mouth \\
Borne down \\
Around the Horn [^capehorn] \\
Extreme south

[^woodpecker]:
    *[Melanerpes
    rubricapillus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-crowned_Woodpecker)*, also
    known as the red-crowned woodpecker, is a woodpecker native to Central and
    South America.

[^capehorn]:
    [Cape Horn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Horn) is the southernmost
    point of Tierra del Fuego. It is the southernmost major sailing obstacle
    for traversing South America.

## Brandy Let's Go ## {#brandy}

You say I'd forgotten what being young's all about \\
How could you say that to me \\
You say I don't know how to have fun anymore
Well, that just may be \\
But it may be otherwise \\
Try me \\
And if it isn't so \\
I got a handgun \\
And a bottle of brandy \\
Let's go

You try and trace Taurus [^taurus] in the sky for me \\
But I know you don't know what you're doing \\
But when I turn my face toward the cold, clean sidewalk \\
I can see the world glowing \\
You say I've forgotten what love's all about \\
You say I don't know how to shake the cobwebs out \\
I look into your eyes \\
And I see the fury grow \\
I got a handgun \\
And a bottle of brandy \\
Let's go

[^taurus]:
    [Taurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(constellation)) is one of
    the twelve Zodiac constellations.
