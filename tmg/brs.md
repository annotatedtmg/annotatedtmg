[^brstitle]:
    My best guess is that the title refers to the painting, which appears to
    have been done by a friend. If you know more about this, I'd love to hear
    from you.

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

ONE DAY AGAMEMNON WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET.

We are Rosanne, Amy, John, Sara, and Raaachel. We recorded these songs in
Summer 1993 here in California. Bob Durkee sequenced them; Steve Kronk
engineered the first one. The cover is an original artwork by Mark GIVENS so
thank you Mark for the nice painting. The model for the cover was Mr. Do so
thank you Joel for Mr. Do.
{: .in}

HE COULD HEAR THE MUSIC OF THE HOUSE-CURSE [^housecurse] IN THE RUSTLING
LEAVES AND FEEL ITS RHYTHMS UNDERFOOT. THE LIGHT WIND [^wind] BLOWING WAS NICE
AND COOL AND UP IN THE FOOTHILLS HE THOUGHT HE SAW A RING-NECKED PHEASANT. IT
WAS NOT A RING-NECKED PHEASANT.

Side 1 has four songs and these are their names: Itzcuintl-Totzli Days. New
Star Song. Song for Cleomenes. Sendero Luminoso Verdadero. Side 2 also has
four songs but their names are different: Song for Mark and Joel. Going to
Maryland. Seeing Daylight. Resonant Bell World.

THEN THE GROUND OPENED UP AND THE EARTH RECEIVED HIM. DOWN THERE THE AIR WAS
WARM AND INVIGORATING.

THIS IS SHRIMPER 99. I have a terrific fever but it's nothing that some hot
coffee wouldn't fix.
{: .in}

AGAMEMNON SMILED. IT HAD BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE HE HAD FELT LIKE SMILING.
THERE WAS MUSIC TRILLING IN THE AIR, AND OLD VOICES: FAINT, UNCERTAIN.

Thanks to all the people we usually thank but new thanks to Gary from Revolver
and to Car In Car Disco Product for making everyone so very happy. Thanks also
to Aeschylus, though he probably would have found this record confusing on a
number of levels. Special thanks to whoever had the original idea for coffee.
It was a really, really good idea.

CHILLING AND FAMILIAR. LIKE A WIND CHIME.

[^housecurse]:
    In Greek mythology, Agamemnon was a descendent of the house of Atreus.
    Atreus was a king of Mycenae, descended from Pelops; his lineage bore a
    curse as a result of Pelops' deceit of the divine hero Myrtilus. [The
    Curse of the House of
    Atreus](http://www.haverford.edu/classics/courses/2005F/lat001/handouts/House_of_Atreus.pdf),

    College, retrieved January 29, 2013.

[^wind]:
    The goddess Artemis punished Agamemnon for boasting that he was a better
    hunter than she, and killing a sacred stag, by causing the winds to die
    down as Agamemnon's Greek army prepared to sail on Troy. Agamemnon
    sacrificed his own daughter, Iphigenia, to regain the favor of Artemis,
    who then allowed the Greek ships to sail. It is unknown whether this
    reference was intended. [Agamemnon](http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/A-Am/Agamemnon.html),

## Itzcuintli-Totzli Days [^itzcuintliseries] ## {#itzcuintli}

I hear the pads beat, loud as drums \\
I know he's coming, let him come

Let the big big rabbit [^itzcuintli] come out \\
Let the big big rabbit come down \\
Let him cast his shadow on the bright face of our little house \\
Let him dance through the garden \\
Let him come

It's getting darker, as the sky grows colder \\
And I feel your hand on my naked shoulder \\
Praise God, I know you're with me, I know you're here \\
And I can feel you breathing, I know you're near me, OK

Let the big big rabbit come out \\
Let the big big rabbit come down \\
Let him cast his shadow on the bright face of our little house \\
Let him dance through the garden \\
Let him come

[^itzcuintliseries]:
    Itzcuintli-Totzli Days is part of the [informal series of Aztec
    songs](series.html#aztec).

[^itzcuintli]:
    The Tonalpohualli, the sacred Aztec calendar, divides the days among the
    Aztec gods, keeping the divine forces competing for power in equilibrium.
    Day Itzcuintli (Dog) is governed by Mictlantecuhtli, God of Death -
    Itzcuintli is the guide for the dead, the spirit world's link with the
    living, and these days are considered good for funerals and remembrance of
    the dead. Day Tochtli (Rabbit) is governed by Mayahuel, Goddess of the
    Maguey and of Fertility - these days signify a selfless religious
    attitude, and are considered good for communing with nature and spirits.

## New Star Song [^starjohn] ## {#star}

I hung pictures of you from every lamp post in town \\
As the humidity climbed into numbers I don't care to repeat \\
The air was heavy and the sky was alive \\
And the Pacific Starlight train [^starlight] wasn't due in till 11:45

I thought about how cold you must be \\
I thought about things I thought that I'd soon be forgetting \\
I thought of you up in Canada as the lightning storms lit up \\
All downtown Redding [^redding]

There were teenagers in mini-trucks coming around every corner \\
You could taste the adrenaline, coming out through their skin \\
I came to the well-lit doorway of a sheet music store \\
Saw my face in the glass, sat down in the doorway and I settled in

I thought about how cold you must be \\
I thought about things I thought that I'd soon be forgetting \\
I thought of you up in Canada as the lightning storms lit up \\
All downtown Redding

[^starjohn]:
    "It's actually based on genuine experience, except for the 'you' being
    addressed in the song --- there is no 'you', right? But I really did spend
    a good 14 hours up in far Northern California; and this is about that
    afternoon, where I watched all four movies at a fourplex... and none of
    them were any good." --- February 6, 1998, Cow Haus, Tallahassee

[^starlight]:

## Song for Cleomenes [^cleomenesseries] [^cleomenes] ## {#cleomenes}

73 years before the advent of the Christian era \\
As Rome was taking over any land within reach \\
Setting up proxy governments in the conquered lands \\
There lived one such man given just such a job \\
Gaius Verres [^gauis] --- go!

A praetor held a position which operated on trust \\
He was to govern instead of the emperor himself \\
It was an easy, easy privilege to abuse \\
And Verres did so

He was the governor of Agrigentum which we now know as Sicily [^agrigentum] \\
And he stole everything that wasn't nailed down \\
Took improper advantage of other men's wives \\
The list goes on, trust me \\
Cicero wrote it all down

At Syracuse Verres welcomed a band of pirates \\
They all drank and danced and sang on the shore \\
And when the husband of one of Verres' paramours \\
Came bringing a fleet of boats with him \\
Verres, clever, if diabolical, gave him a job [^job] \\
And enlisted the pirates to burn the whole fleet down

The boats burned in the Sicilian harbor \\
The flames rose hundreds of feet into the air \\
We stood on the shore watching them burn \\
We stood on the shore, we heard the old songs, hey!

[^cleomenesseries]:
    Song for Cleomenes is part of the [Song for ...
    series](series.html#songfor).

[^cleomenes]:
    According to Cicero's *In Verrem*, Cleomenes was commander of a fleet
    expedition sent by Gaius Verres to destroy a group of pirates in the area
    who, due to incompetence, allowed the pirates to enter into Syracuse
    harbor and sack the town. [In
    Verrem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Verrem), Wikipedia, retrieved
    January 29, 2013.

[^gauis]:
    Gaius Verres (ca. 120 BC -- 43 BC) was a Roman magistrate, notorious for
    his misgovernment of Sicily.

[^agrigentum]:
    [Agrigento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrigento), Agrigentum in Latin,
    is a city and province in Sicily. It does not actually refer to the whole
    island. Thanks to [Sarah
    Margaret](http://www.themountaingoats.net/misc/cleomenes.html) for
    catching this.

[^job]:
    In *In Verrem*, Cicero argues that Verres sent Cleomenes after the pirates
    to keep him out of reach as Verres cuckolded him.

## Sendero Luminoso Verdadero [^sendero] ## {#sendero}

*"As they age, men encounter the 6th fear --- loss of virility. Just look him
straight in the eye, invade his space by standing a little closer than
normal..."* [^selfhelp]

By 8:30 am the sun was so hot that it made me remember \\
And I pulled on the jacket with the bars on the pocket \\
And I stood in front of the window \\
And the skin on my face has a memory all its own \\
And it drinks in the pure heat, real slow \\
I remember Lima [^lima], I remember the good life \\
I remember Lima, I remember the good life

The window is ten feet high and three feet wide \\
Sun beams bounce off the dark water \\
And come through the clear glass, magnified \\
Standing here in the house on Pacific Coast Highway [^pch] \\
Given to me by a friend whose name is no longer important \\
My conscience is clean \\
And the feeling of power like thick red wine \\
And it's oh-nine-oh-five military time \\
I remember Lima, I remember the good life \\
I remember Lima, I remember the good life

[^sendero]:
    Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) is a Maoist communist organization in
    Peru, who at its peak in 1980 held the goal of replacing what it saw as
    bourgeois democracy with pure Communism.  The group is on the U.S.
    Department of State's list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, and the EU
    and Canada also describe it as a terrorist organization and prohibit
    providing funding or other financial support. [Shining
    Path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Path), Wikipedia, retrieved

    If you know the source of this recording, which sounds like a self-help
    tape, I'd love to hear about it.  The track ends with sounds from it as
    well.

## Song for Mark and Joel [^markjoelseries] [^markjoel] ## {#markjoel}

I opened up the window and the cold air came in \\
And I saw a bird on a branch outside that I had never seen before \\
He looked a robin, but it had an upside down V-shaped red mark on its chest \\
And I had a special feeling in my mind, I had a special feeling in my mind \\
I had a certain glint in my eye \\
On the morning trouble came by

There was a map of the American Midwest on one wall \\
And there was a map of the American West on another wall \\
And there was a map of Rome on the third wall \\
And there were maps in all directions \\
I was looking at them pondering connections \\
When trouble came by

Then I stuck my head out the window \\
I had to stick my head out the window \\
It was much colder than I'd imagined it would be \\
It was much much colder than I'd imagined it would be \\
It was much much colder \\
It was much much colder and trouble came by

    It seems reasonable to guess that Mark and Joel are the same individuals
    mentioned in the [liner notes](#liner) --- Mark Givens, who painted the

    the white rat). Both were members of the band [Wckr

    Mountain Goats, and Joel performs as Furniture Huschle, whose songs [have

## Going to Maryland [^marylandseries] ## {#maryland}

The water's real cool and the water's real sweet \\
Here's hoping that no points repeat \\
Because I bet against the chances that you'd ever be mine \\
Laid everything down on the don't pass line [^dontpass] \\
And it's a stupid trick of fortune anyway \\
But the lights are bright tonight \\
And your eyes shine tonight on Chesapeake Bay [^chesapeake]

Walk through the water and our feet get wet \\
And on the dark ended water I see your silhouette \\
5 dollars says that it's gone in a minute \\
5 dollars says that your heart goes with it \\
And it's a stupid trick of fortune anyway \\
But the lights are bright tonight \\
And your eyes shine tonight on Chesapeake Bay

    In the game of craps, a don't-pass bet is a wager that the shooter of the

    roll a 7 before repeating the point.

## Seeing Daylight ## {#seeing}

Two cans clear chicken broth \\
Two white onions \\
One bulb garlic

Boil, boil \\
Boil, boil

And the screams of delight from the pool outside, the splashing sounds \\
The coffee heating up on the stove \\
The sky outside the color of pure fresh milk

Boil, boil \\
Boil, boil

And the phone ringing, and me picking it up \\
And watching myself do so in the quiet room \\
In the June evening and your voice on the other end \\
And the impossibility of your voice on the other end

And the impossible echo inside

Boil, boil \\
Boil, boil

## Resonant Bell World ## {#resonant}

Sometimes you're a starling \\
Sometimes you're a kite \\
You're a hyena from early to mid afternoon \\
You're a stray dog at night

It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen \\
How you will not act like a human being

When you put on your special coat \\
And you made your special lunge for my throat \\
Between you and me \\
It was, it was, really exciting

It's the most alarming thing I've ever seen \\
How you will not act like a human being \\
It's the most incredible thing I've ever seen \\
How you refuse to act like a human being

In the starlight \\
In the starlight \\
In the starlight \\
In the starlight \\
In the starlight \\
In the starlight \\
In the starlight \\
In the starlight
