 [^heretictitle]:
    "I didn't know that I had ripped it off...  I'm not trying to get away
    with anything. But, I wrote it in a notebook at some point, where I was
    storing titles... And I was like, 'That's just too good a phrase, you
    can't have made that up.' And I started combing through all my stuff to
    figure it out... Aura Noir is this sort of black-slash-thrash band, and
    they had this phrase, 'heretic pride', in one of their lyrics, and I had
    unconsciously lifted it and made what I took from it the subject of my
    song." --- WNYC session, March 11, 2008

    The Aura Noir line which John references above is from Black Deluge Night:
    "Bereft of air the earth trembles wide / Cracks all mountains high /
    Soaring demons now swarm the skies / In awe and heretic pride."

    The album was originally going to be titled The Vision As It Appeared to
    the Serpent or Great Sterile Transparent Jellies. --- [Sam Means

[^hereticwriting]:
    "\[Heretic Pride\] was the first one-song-at-a-time no-theme record I'd done
    in forever. Felt so good. I was just indulging all these old obsessions,
    interests, fetishes of mine - kind of like, you know, when you spend a
    night on eBay looking at stuff and thinking 'I'm gonna buy all that stuff
    --- old leather football helmets, stained-glass beer mirrors, really old
    loteria sets': really for me, in spirit, this album felt like when I was
    writing the songs that became Hot Garden Stomp - every little minor
    obsession of mine just blowing up and possessing me for a day. So, no, I
    didn't conceive it as a thing I was going to do, but I've done sort of
    'let the machine assemble itself' records before and I have a lot of faith
    in that process." --- [Sam Means Interviews John Darnielle of the Mountain

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

As part of the Heretic Pride press kit, John wrote about every song in a three
page comic which was illustrated by musician and comics artist Jeffrey Lewis.
It is referenced extensively in the text below and is [available in
full](http://www.thejeffreylewissite.com/Mt-Goats-Press-Kit-08.html) on
Lewis's website ([mirror](mirror/heretic-press-kit.pdf)).

### Related material ### {#related}

Heretic Pride has two extras which were released with some versions of the
album, [Last Man on Earth](#lastman) and [Toolshed](#toolshed). In addition,
demos exist of Last Man on Earth, Toolshed, and [Michael Myers
Resplendent](#myers), which are discussed more with the individual songs.
These demos are often collectively referred to as Songs for Vamsidasa
Babaji,[^vamsidasajohn] [^vamsidasa] [^vamsidasaseries] as they are all tagged as coming from that supposed album.

[^vamsidasajohn]:
    John has clarified that this was not a real album title (although I've
    still included it in the [Song for ... series](series.html#songfor)), but
    that the tagging was part of his organization process:

    I feel like I addressed this at one point, maybe with a different title,
    but: back in the old days, when every time I'd write a song it'd go on a
    tape, the tapes had their own titles. Occasionally these titles would go
    on to title a release ("Beautiful Rat Sunset" was one of them) but more
    often they were just spur-of-the-moment/whimsical/inside-joke titles. Now
    that demos are stored on a hard drive instead of on tapes, the playlists
    have titles like that. That's all. There is no "Songs for Vamsidasa
    Babaji," but there are a bunch of demos whose tags claim that they come
    from such an album The more you know!

## Sax Rohmer #1 [^saxjohn] [^saxtitle] [^saxvideo] ## {#sax}

Fog lifts from the harbor \\
Dawn goes down today [^frost] \\
An agent crests the shadows of a nearby alleyway

Piles of broken bricks \\
Signposts on the path \\
Every moment points towards the aftermath \\
Yeah

Sailors straggle back \\
From their nights out on the town \\
Hopeless urchins from the city \\
Gather around

Spies from Imperial China [^china] \\
Wash in on the tide \\
Every battle tends towards \\
Surrender on both sides

And I am coming home to you \\
With my own blood in my mouth \\
And I am coming home to you \\
If it's the last thing that I do

Bells ring in the tower \\
Wolves howl in the hills \\
Chalk marks show up \\
On a few high windowsills

And a rabbit gives up somewhere \\
And a dozen hawks descend \\
Every moment leads towards its own sad end \\
Yeah

Ships loosed from their moorings \\
Capsize and then are gone \\
Sailors without captains watch a while and then move on

And an agent crests the shadow \\
And I head in her direction \\
All roads lead towards \\
The same blocked intersection

I am coming home to you \\
With my own blood in my mouth \\
And I am coming home to you \\
If it's the last thing that I do

[^saxjohn]:
    "Written in my cave-like office in Durham\[.\] Sax Rohmer wrote pulp spy
    novels, and there's lots about them that's pretty objectionable; the
    character Fu Manchu is his best-known invention. But there's a feeling of
    menace and threat in his stories that's kind of addictive. And the
    tight-frame atmosphere he crafts has a real appeal to it, especially if
    you're working in a room with concrete floors and without any natural
    light." --- Heretic Pride press kit

    John discusses Lovecraft and Sax Rohmer both extensively in his interview
    on WNYC, March 11, 2008, particularly explaining that their experience of
    alienation and generation of vivid imagery interested him while he
    repudiated the xenophobia that motivated them.

[^saxtitle]:
    [Sax Rohmer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sax_Rohmer) was born Arthur
    Henry Sarsfield Ward in 1883 and died in 1959 after writing over 50
    novels.

    His first book written under his own name, and also the first book in the
    Fu Manchu series, was *[The Mystery of Dr. Fu
    Manchu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_Dr._Fu-Manchu)*.

[^saxvideo]:
    Sax Rohmer #1 is one of the few Mountain Goats songs which has a [music
    video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUbFljMLIY8). Directed by Ace
    Norton, it features the band playing in a dark building with the lyrics
    written on the walls and band members.

[^frost]:
    This line could easily be borrowed from the Robert Frost poem, Nothing
    Gold Can Stay:

    Nature's first green is gold, \\
    Her hardest hue to hold. \\
    Her early leaf's a flower; \\
    But only so an hour. \\
    Then leaf subsides to leaf. \\
    So Eden sank to grief, \\
    So dawn goes down to day. \\
    Nothing gold can stay.

[^china]:
    China was [structured as an
    empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_China) roughly from
    unification during the Qin dynasty in 221 BC until the formation of the
    Republic of China (Taiwan) in 1912.

## San Bernardino [^bernardinojohn] [^bernardinoseries] [^bernardinoloc] ## {#bernardino}

We got in your car and we hit the highway [^highway] \\
Eastern sun was rising over the mountains \\
Yellow and blood-red bits \\
Like a kaleidoscope

And flaming swords may guard the Garden of Eden [^genesis324a] \\
But we consulted maps from earlier days \\
Dead languages on our tongues \\
Holding on to our last hope \\
And the day was bright and fine \\
And the highway sign \\
Said, "San Bernardino welcomes you"

I checked us into our hotel and filled the bathtub \\
And you got in the warm warm water \\
I pulled petals from my pocket \\
I loved you so much just then

And it was hard but you were brave, you are splendid \\
And we will never be alone in this world \\
No matter what they say \\
We're gonna be O.K.

We were safe inside \\
And our new son cried \\
"San Bernardino welcomes you"

[^bernardinojohn]:
    "This is a song about a young unmarried couple giving birth in a cheap
    motel off the 10 Freeway out towards the high desert in California." ---
    Heretic Pride press kit

    "Here, however, the story is pretty clear, or I hope it is, and the song
    gave me a pretty good punch in the face as soon as we were done recording
    it, because I just lost my mind for about five minutes. Gone. Slumped over
    a piano a few feet from the microphone I'd been singing into, Erik
    Friedlander sitting in his chair where he'd been playing. (I did my vocal
    live with one of the cello parts, sitting facing Erik as he played.) I was
    thinking again about people who others talk down to: young mothers and
    fathers who have no prospects, no money, nothing going on.

    "The two kids here give birth in a cheap motel somewhere in San Bernardino,
    probably right off the freeway, and the young man tries to express his
    love for the girl who's about to give birth. Which she does, and they feel
    at home in the world, even though the world isn't giving them its best
    yet. I feel hope for them, because they love each other. I know that that
    is a corny thing to say, so for people who have corn allergies I
    apologize. But these two, they're going to be the future, so it'd be
    awesome if we could give them enough leeway to become who they're gonna
    become, and encourage them when we can. I have a fondness for them though
    I barely know them. Their feeling for one another inspires me, is what it
    is." --- February 15, 2008, My Five Favorite Mountain Goats Characters,

    "Having now been in a labor and delivery room, like, the idea of, like, a
    really tranquil, like, rose petal scene and everybody's all, 'Oh, here's
    the lovely little baby' --- and in a Motel 6, that ain't happening. That
    motel has blood on the walls. Cops are coming, 'Why are people screaming
    for eight consecutive hours in that room? Oh, because a very large thing
    is trying to push itself through a very small space.'" ---

[^bernardinoseries]:
    San Bernardino is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^bernardinoloc]:
    [San Bernardino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Bernardino) is a city
    located in the Inland Empire area of Southern California, near where John
    began playing music.

[^highway]:
    As mentioned in the above [footnote](#fn:bernardinojohn), the highway
    most likely refers to the [10
    Freeway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_10_(California)), an
    interstate freeway which runs through the southern part of San Bernardino.
    It is also referenced in Short Song for the 10 Freeway.

    sword east of the garden of Eden to guard the way to the tree of life."

## Heretic Pride [^hereticjohn] ## {#heretic}

Well they come and pull me from my house \\
And they drag my body through the streets \\
And the sun so hot I think I'll catch fire and burn up \\
In the summer air so moist and sweet

And the people all come out to cheer \\
Rocks in the pathway break my skin \\
And there's honeysuckle on the faint breeze today \\
With every breath I'm drawing in

I wanna cry out \\
But I don't scream and I don't shout \\
And I feel so proud to be alive \\
And I feel so proud when the reckoning arrives

The crowds grow denser by the second \\
As we near the center of the town \\
And they dig a trench in the main square right there \\
And they pick me up and throw me down

And I start laughing like a child \\
And I mark their faces one by one \\
Transfiguration's gonna come for me at last \\
And I will burn hotter than the sun

I waited so long \\
And now I taste jasmine on my tongue \\
And I feel so proud to be alive \\
And I feel so proud when the reckoning arrives

[^hereticjohn]:
    "Title unconsciously cribbed from some Aura Noir lyrics --- I am always
    happy to learn that black metal phrasings have burrowed their way into my
    subconscious. You could call this song a persecution fantasy, but really,
    who can even say the word 'fantasy' without flinching? Not me, and I have
    a stronger stomach than most. Spoiler alert: the main character here will
    not live long after he gets done lauding his imminent demise." --- Heretic
    Pride press kit

    "But that song, the title track, that's about a guy really getting into
    how he's about to suffer a really painful death. When people talk about
    'living life to the fullest' they often mean they're gonna have a bitchin'
    weekend or whatever, or an intense relationship, but to me, you know who
    lived life to the fullest? Martyrs. People who got thrown to lions and had
    to listen to tens of thousand of people applauding while the lions ate
    them alive. Those are guys who are really drinking life to the lees,
    right? So that's what heretic pride is - really enthusiastic role
    acceptance." --- [Sam Means Interviews John Darnielle of the Mountain

## Autoclave [^autoclavejohn] ## {#autoclave}

Lend me your hand \\
Let me look in your eyes \\
As my last chance to feel human \\
Begins to vaporize \\
Maybe it's the heat in here \\
Maybe it's the pressure [^autoclaveheat] \\
You oughtta head for the exits \\
The sooner the better

I am this great mass of blood and foam \\
And no one in her right mind \\
Would make my home her home \\
My heart's an autoclave \\
My heart's an autoclave

When I try to open up to you \\
I get completely lost \\
Houses swallowed by the earth \\
Windows thick with frost \\
And I reach deep down within \\
But the pathways twist and turn \\
And there's no light anywhere \\
And nothing left to burn

And I am this great unstable mass of blood and foam \\
And no emotion that's worth having \\
Could call my heart its home \\
My heart's an autoclave \\
My heart's an autoclave

I dreamt that I was perched atop \\
A throne of human skulls \\
On a cliff above the ocean \\
Howling wind and shrieking seagulls \\
And the dream went on forever \\
One single static frame \\
Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name [^cheers]

And I am this great unstable mass of blood and foam \\
And no one in her right mind \\
Would make my home her home \\
My heart's an autoclave \\
My heart's an autoclave

[^autoclavejohn]:
    "I was in Alaska when I read about the discovery of a life-form that can
    not only survive an autoclave (the instrument used for sterilizing
    surgical instruments; it's supposed to kill any and all bacteria on the
    tools), but which seems to really enjoy the whole autoclave scene: at
    temperatures fatal to all other life forms, this bacteria would begin to
    breed. Naturally, this got me to thinking aobut people whose hearts
    involuntarily pulverize any good feelings that come within a city block of
    them." --- Heretic Pride press kit

    The organism that John refers to could be any of a variety of
    hyperthermophiles, but I would guess either *[Methanopyrus

    barossii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_121)*.

    Boston bar:

    Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name \\
    And they're always glad you came \\
    You wanna be where you can see our troubles are all the same \\
    You wanna be where everybody knows your name

    It was written by Gary Portnoy in 1982.

## New Zion [^zionjohn] [^zionseries] [^newzion] ## {#zion}

There were signs up in the sky \\
When we gathered by the garden wall \\
Everybody on his best behavior \\
Listening for the altar call

High priest of Salem in his robes [^salempriest] \\
Ranting at the coming of the day \\
Ravens at the gates \\
Frightening all the visitors away

I laid down by the water \\
Dreamed a dream of where I come from \\
Old things made new [^2corinthians517] \\
Waiting for you

There were wooden wind chimes rustling \\
In the trees above the anthills on the dunes \\
On the high winds we could hear them \\
Old familiar tunes

The little bit of faith we had once \\
Like the memory of a movie \\
They got burned up in the great fire \\
Reassembling itself slowly but surely

I laid down by the water \\
Dreamed a dream of where I come from \\
Old things made new \\
Waiting for you

    "How come we never hear about religious cults anymore? The high hollering
    days of cultmania that made my childhood such a thrill: what was the real
    risk that I'd talk to some robed fellow on the street one day and find
    myself instantly, involuntarily converted to some bizarre creed? Really,
    the cults were secondonly to Santa Claus in their mysterious powers. 'New
    Zion' is only about an imaginary cult but I hope someone starts it up real
    soon\[.\]" --- Heretic Pride press kit

## So Desperate [^desperatejohn] ## {#desperate}

We were parked in your car \\
In our neutral meeting place \\
The Episcopalian [^episcopalian] churchyard \\
Ahaha

I had things I'd been meaning to say \\
But in the dazzling winter sun that late \\
I could feel them melt away \\
And through the warm radio static \\
I couldn't hear my stage directions \\
And the fog on the windshield \\
Obscured our sad reflections \\
Ahhaha

I felt so desperate in your arms \\
I felt so desperate in your arms

We were parked near some trees \\
And the moonlight soaked the branched \\
In ever deepening degrees \\
Had my hand in your hair \\
Trying to keep my cool \\
Til it became to much to bear

When we cracked the windows open \\
Well the air was just so sweet \\
We could hear the cars ten feet away \\
Out there on the street

I felt so desperate in your arms \\
I felt so desperate in your arms \\
I felt so desperate in your arms

[^desperatejohn]:
    "A love song about people who're involved with each other when they
    probably shouldn't be\[.\] And about how the head and shame of the whole
    situation is like a snake eating its own tail, except the tail grows
    faster than he can eat it. Odds are that somebody reading this knows
    exactly what I mean and feels a little uncomfortable reading about it: 2
    -- 1\[.\]" --- Heretic Pride press kit

## In the Craters on the Moon [^cratersjohn] ## {#craters}

If the strain proves too much \\
Give up right away \\
If the light hurts your eyes \\
Stay in your room all day \\
When the room fills with smoke \\
Lie down on the floor \\
In the declining years \\
Of the long war [^longwar]

Well the blood's in the water \\
And the shark's gonna come \\
And we swim in the dark \\
Until our bodies are numb \\
Blind desert rats in the moonlight \\
Too far from shore \\
In the declining years \\
Of the long war

Empty room with a lightbulb \\
Where the phone starts to ring \\
Everybody gets nervous \\
Nobody says anything \\
Next day someone's initials \\
Show up on the door \\
I think I'm gonna crack \\
Can't live like this anymore \\
Ugly things in the darkness \\
Worse things in store \\
In the declining years \\
Of the long war

[^cratersjohn]:
    "It is the natural condition of my characters, when a few of them have
    gathered together, to find themselves secluded in a near-lightless room
    waiting for some unspecified disaster. Frankly I suspect that this is
    the natural condition of a pretty hefty percentage of the general
    populace. The people in this song have reached a point of comfort with
    their dread: ready for panic to set in, relishing the moment." ---
    Heretic Pride press kit

    John has emphatically stated that this is not a political song. See the
    Largehearted Boy interview with Sam Means cited above and the March 11,
    2008 WNYC session.

[^longwar]:
    "A couple of people have said there's political stuff in this record, I
    hadn't really --- I mean, I gather 'In the Craters on the Moon' has the
    word 'war' in it, so people think I'm talking about a specific war, but
    when I say a 'long war', a 'long war' is not five or ten or fifteen years,
    a 'long war' is hundreds of years." --- WNYC session, March 11, 2008

## Lovecraft in Brooklyn [^lovecraftjohn] [^hplovecraft] ## {#lovecraft}

It's gonna be too hot to breathe today \\
When everybody's out here on the streets \\
Somebody's opened up a fire hydrant \\
Cold water rushing out in sheets

Some kid in a Marcus Allen jersey [^marcus] \\
Asked me for a cigarette \\
Companionship is where you find it \\
So I take what I can get

Hubcaps on the cars like funhouse mirrors \\
Stick to the shadows when I can \\
Lovecraft in Brooklyn

When the sun goes down the armies of the voiceless \\
Several hundred thousand strong \\
Come out without their bandages \\
Their voices raised in song

When the streetlights sputter out \\
They make this awful sizzling sound \\
I cast my face towards the pavement \\
Too many bloodstains on the ground

Rhode Island drops into the ocean \\
No place to call home anymore [^rhodeisland] \\
Lovecraft in Brooklyn

Head outside most every day \\
To try to keep the wolves away \\
Imagine nice things I might say \\
If company should come

Woke up afraid of my own shadow \\
Like genuinely afraid \\
Headed for the pawnshop \\
To buy myself a switchblade \\
Someday something's coming \\
From way out beyond the stars \\
To kill us while we stand here \\
It'll store our brains in Mason jars

And then the girl behind the counter \\
She asks me how I feel today \\
I feel like Lovecraft in Brooklyn \\
Yeah

    "American horror icon H. P. Lovecraft moved to Red Hook, Brooklyn to be
    with the woman he loved. He had never really seen any people who were not
    white folks from Massachusetts. Immigrants were spilling into Brooklyn
    from the four corners of the globe. Lovecraft's xenophobia during his time
    in Brooklyn resulted in some of the weirdest, darkest images in all
    American literature. One must condemn Lovecraft's ugly racism, of course,
    but his not-unrelated inclination toward of general suspicion of anything
    that's alive is pretty fertile ground." --- Heretic Pride press kit

    "\[This\] is *the* loudest I've ever sung on a record." --- WNYC session,
    March 11, 2008

    John discusses Lovecraft and Sax Rohmer both extensively in his interview
    on WNYC, March 11, 2008, particularly explaining that their experience of
    alienation and generation of vivid imagery interested him while he
    repudiated the xenophobia that motivated them.

[^hplovecraft]:
    [H. P. Lovecraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft) was an
    American speculative fiction author, famous for practically inventing the

## Tianchi Lake [^tianchijohn] [^tianchiloc] ## {#tianchi}

Children by the water banks \\
Laughing long and loud \\
Changbai's high fine western peaks [^changbai] \\
Just beneath the clouds \\
Currents in the water \\
Churning in their course \\
Body of a sea lion \\
Head just like a horse

Preacher in the soft brown sand \\
Begins to speak his piece \\
High winds in the treetops \\
Low flying winter geese \\
No one taking pictures \\
Everybody's still \\
And then the water sought its course again \\
The way that waters will

No one at the lakeside now \\
Moon up in the sky \\
Night birds in the dragon spruce \\
Moaning long and high \\
Back stroking on the surface \\
Moonlight on its face \\
Floats the Tianchi monster \\
Staring into space

Out around the temple now \\
Narcissus in bloom \\
Censers packed with sandalwood \\
Send smoke into the room \\
Children in the sand outside \\
On their hands and knees \\
Sketching pictures all day long \\
Of stranger things than these

## How to Embrace a Swamp Creature [^swampjohn] [^swampseries] ## {#swamp}

Got out of bed \\
Could not remember my own name \\
Condemned to walk the soil \\
Amongst all creatures wild and tame

Go where I go \\
Do what I must \\
Crawl starving on my belly \\
Licking up the dry dust [^genesis314]

I see the light in your window \\
Ride the elevator to the sixth floor \\
Stand with my arms at my sides \\
As you open up the door

But I'm out of my element \\
I can't breathe \\
I'm out of my element \\
I can't breathe

Alone with your bathroom mirror \\
Try to get my head straight \\
Breathe on the glass and wait for it to clear \\
Clean slate

Meet up with you in the kitchen \\
Where the air is hot and dry \\
Open up all the faucets \\
Be fruitful and multiply [^genesis97]

I stand where the flashing swords gleam [^genesis324b] \\
And I try to shake my head clear of the dream

But I'm out of my element \\
I can't breathe \\
I'm out of my element \\
I can't breathe

I start to sweat I can't cool down \\
I'm scared of all the strangers in this town \\
I try to tell you just why I've come \\
It's like I've got molasses on my tongue

I made it through town somehow \\
But who's gonna save me now

I'm out of my element \\
I can't breathe \\
I'm out of my element \\
I can't breathe

    "This is a song about sleeping with somebody with whom you've just parted
    ways and with whom you later tell yourself you had no intention of
    sleeping on that day when you 'stopped by' to pick up your stuff, or to
    'just say hi,' or whatever other excuse you feel like using. It's all
    good, y'all, you ain't gotta lie to me." --- Heretic Pride press kit

[^swampseries]:
    How to Embrace a Swamp Creature is part of the informal [series of
    Biblical references](series.html#bible).

[^genesis314]:
    A direct reference to the banishment of the serpent from the Garden of
    Eden. "Then the Lord God said to the serpent: Because you have done this,
    you are cursed more than any livestock and more than any wild animal. You
    will move on your belly and eat dust all the days of your life." ---

    Given the other references to Genesis in this song, this is possibly a
    reference to the flaming swords guarding Eden from Genesis 3:24, also seen
    in [San Bernardino](#fn:genesis324a). However, this could also refer to
    any swordfight.

## Marduk T-shirt Men's Room Incident [^marduk] [^mardukjohn] ## {#marduk}

Slumped up against the sink \\
Hair plastered to her cheeks \\
Marduk t-shirt sticking to her skin \\
Refugee from a disco in old East Berlin [^eastberlin]

Weightless \\
Formless \\
Blameless \\
Nameless

Stray syllables were gurgling \\
From her throat one at a time \\
Face hidden from my view \\
I let myself imagine she was you

Only weightless \\
Formless \\
Blameless \\
Nameless

And when I washed my hands \\
I ran the water hotter than I could stand

Half rising to a crouch \\
Sinking back down to the floor \\
In your walking keep your head low \\
Try to leave no traces when you go

Stay weightless \\
Formless \\
Blameless \\
Nameless

    mistrustful of such stories --- but this one sort of just jumped up out of

    "This is a song about a guy who goes into the men's room --- to use the
    men's room, and there's a woman in there, who looks like she's completely
    out of it, and doesn't really even know he's there. It's sad." ---
    Hopscotch, Durham, September 9, 2012

    John has always been adamant that this song is not about any kind of
    violent encounter, beginning soon after the album's release when the song
    was misconstrued on the forums as being about rape:

    > although I generally don't weigh in on interpretive questions, I'm going
    > to make an exception here. I would not be interested in singing from the
    > perspective of a rapist. some writers might; good luck to them; I
    > wouldn't. richardob is correct in his interpretation. the narrator is
    > moved by the plight of the woman he sees; the details of the plight are
    > obscure to the reader/listener, permanently, since we're only hearing the
    > report of an observer with minimal information. the lyric seems pretty
    > clear and straightforward to me:
    >
    > *slumped up against the sink,*
    > *hair plastered to her cheek*
    > *marduk t-shirt sticking to her skin*
    > *refugee from a disco in old east berlin*
    >
    > -\- this is the narrator reporting, honestly, on the evidence of his
    > senses. He has thoughts and feelings arising from this information, and he
    > reports the same. we don't know what the deal is with the woman. we're
    > never going to know. that is kind of the point.

    Continuing in a later post, discussing how an artist can't control
    interpretation after a piece is released:

    > as you probably know, I generally agree with you, but again there's some
    > points on which one wishes to say "no, y'all, you seem to have some other
    > writer in mind - I wouldn't write a song trying to humanize a rapist."
    > just providing a general direction, not a final reading! anybody who wants
    > to argue that the song is actually a recipe for borscht will also find I
    > think that there are in truth some general parameters of interpretation
    > that're valid, you dig?

    are loving, almost paternal urgings to the listener. Early in his career,

## Michael Myers Resplendent [^myersjohn] [^myersdemo] [^halloween] ## {#myers}

I am ready for my closeup today \\
Too long I've let my self respect stand in my way \\
Well the prom queen's \\
Caught in the high beams \\
And the string's keen \\
It's a big scene

But when the house goes up in flames [^resurrection] \\
No one emerges triumphantly from it \\
When the scum begins to circle the drain \\
Everybody loves a winner

I spent eight hours in my makeup chair \\
Waxed my chest and shaved off all my hair \\
Well the fire's bright \\
And the the frame's tight \\
Try to get right \\
Well we've still got life

But when the house goes up in flames \\
No one emerges triumphantly from it \\
When the scum begins to circle the drain \\
Everybody loves a winner

But when the house goes up in flames \\
When the scum begins to circle the drain

    "When I wrote this I didn't know that they were remaking Halloween --- I
    have a real love for slasher films, probably because when they were a new
    phenomenon I was so terrified just by the newspapers ads that I avoided
    the hell out of them. As a child I was pretty easily frightened, the world
    seemed like a place where all sorts of random devilment could just pop out
    from the woodwork at any second. This song is like Sax Rohmer #1 if the
    narrator had given up on ever actually getting home; of the present bunch,
    this was the first song written. It's also the one that I played piano on,
    which I like to do once each album, since piano was the first instrument I
    ever learned to play." --- Heretic Pride press kit

    John discusses working in stage makeup crews during high school in the

[^myersdemo]:
    A demo for Michael Myers Resplendent exists, released as a Christmas gift
    in 2006, prior to the release of Heretic Pride. It is part of the [Songs
    for Vamsidasa Babaji](#related) collection. John's original post:

    I hope everybody is having a great yule. Did you know that it was once a
    custom in the north of England to cry out "Yule!" in the streets or in
    church after the sermon? Do you not wish we observed this custom
    generally, and loudly, throughout the month of December?

    Moved by the remembered spirit of frozen Mancunians in stovepipe hats
    crying "Yule!" at one another with increasing fury, we offer this site's
    second annual present of an unreleased song. Last year it was two, but
    both of them were old. This one I wrote just last night. If you're a
    person who'll be bummed out by finding a song you already knew on the next
    album, then you might wanna leave this one alone, 'cause it's nearly a
    sure thing that it'll get the studio treatment at some point. There will
    be a lyric change in the chorus when that happens, but I liked the energy
    of this just-wrote-it version, so I'm leaving it as-is.

    The title refers not to [the trance
    DJ](http://www.thedjlist.com/djs/MICHAEL_MYERS/) but to [this
    dude](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N10eQWnqcAw), though it's an
    elliptical reference so if you wanna argue that the song's actually about
    a negative epiphany arrived at through the glory of progressive trance,
    please feel free! This song is part of a series that as yet has no title
    and, as of this writing, only a vague thematic thread. More on this news
    as it develops. Meanwhile, here's a new song in your choice of compressed
    formats. Yule!

Just when the last of the smoke subsides you'll see my fingers \\
Hoisting my body up atop the charred debris \\
Who is that creature with the crazed look in his eyes \\
Don't even question your senses, you can be sure that's me

When all the pretenders to your hand \\
Lie dead across the land \\
I'll be the last man on earth \\
I'll be the last man on earth \\
I'll be the last man on earth \\
Crawling around \\
Down on the ground

When the Hail Marys [^hailmary] you've been saying lose their savor \\
Just when your dungeon walls feel like they're closing in \\
Whose are those bloody knuckles reaching down to grab you \\
Just as the last of the light overhead is growing dim

It was their love you wanted, not mine \\
But when they deny your name three times [^peter] \\
I'll be the last man on earth \\
I'll be the last man on earth \\
I'll be the last man on earth \\
Crawling around \\
Down on the ground

And I will throw you across my shoulder \\
And I will bleed and I will drool \\
And the cameras will slow-pan across my face \\
And I will try to say something cool

Just as the hordes of thirsting demons close around us \\
Raising their axes, howling like monkeys in the sun \\
Who will that guy be holding you so high above them \\
You know and I know, everyone knows it, I'm the one

I may have failed you once before \\
But this right here, this means war \\
I'll be the last man on earth \\
I'll be the last man on earth \\
I'll be the last man on earth \\
Crawling around \\
Down on the ground

    him, these lines from the middle of the song:

    If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now \\
    It's just a spring clean for the May Queen \\
    Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run \\
    There's still time to change the road you're on

    when played backwards, say:

    Oh, here's to my sweet Satan \\
    The one whose path would make me sad, whose power is Satan \\
    He'll give those with him 666 \\
    There was a little toolshed where he made us suffer, sad Satan

    The band has ignored or dismissed these claims as being absurd.

[^satan]:
    Given the [above context](#fn:ledzeppelin), the sad man is clearly Satan.
