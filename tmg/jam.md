[^subpop]:
    From 1988 to 1993, and then again from 1998 to 2002, the Seattle-based Sub
    Pop label operated the Sub Pop Singles Club, a subscription-based vinyl
    collection club in which members would receive monthly limited-press 7" 45
    RPM singles. The Mountain Goats participated in November 2001. The single
    is officially unnamed, and so goes by the names Sub Pop Singles Collection
    V2 #44, its catalog number SP581, its description as Jam Eater Blues b/w
    Store/Straight Six, or by the drawing on the cover and title of the first
    song, Jam Eater Blues, as has been done here.

## Jam Eater Blues [^eaterjohn] ## {#eater}

Life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar \\
Life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar \\
Life is too short to wait around \\
For you to come home tonight \\
Life it too short, too short to do that

Life is too short to leave the windows open all winter long \\
Life is too short to leave the windows open all winter long \\
I'm gonna lock 'em up tight \\
And eat jam out of the jar all night \\
'Cause life is too short to make toast or use spoons or napkins

Life is too short to spend the rest of it down here in Tampa [^tampa] \\
Life is too short to spend the rest of it down here in Tampa \\
Yeah, life is too short to let it go to waste like this \\
But I never tasted jam before that tastes like this \\
And life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar

    been used." --- Crossing Border, Amsterdam, October 9, 1999

## Store [^storejohn] [^storeseries] ## {#store}

In the five-minutes-worth of lost time that I had \\
When I was passed out on the supermarket floor \\
I saw you at the head of the heavenly chorus [^choir] \\
And I heard your song ringing all through the store

In the five minutes when my broadcast got preempted \\
I saw you touch down, you were no longer dead \\
I was happy to see you, I had lots of questions \\
And I put my hand to the wound in your head

Ah, the blood \\
All of that blood \\
All of that warm blood \\
Flowing freely from you

In the five minutes when I was dead to the world \\
In a place far away from my friends and my home \\
I saw you with a smile on your radiant face \\
Amidst all of the cans and the glass and the chrome

And in those five minutes my signal was jammed \\
The frequencies that I received were so pure \\
That I almost believed that the sight of the hole \\
In your skull was a thing that my heart could endure

Ah, the blood \\
All of that blood \\
All of that warm blood \\
Flowing freely from you

[^storejohn]:
    Also called Aisle.

    "I think I wrote this while I was working on The Coroner's Gambit stuff
    and thinking a lot about dead friends... This is a song that I believe is
    called Aisle, but I always want to call it Store, but I could have that
    backwards... It's a terribly gory song, and it's kind of disturbing to me
    to think about this guy having this anti-epiphany walking up and down the
    aisles of the Hy-Vee in Iowa, all brightly lit in the middle of the
    afternoon." --- Zoop, Farm Sanctuary, New York, June 17, 2007

    "This is from a series of songs that I'm writing that I will probably
    never do anything with, I'm just writing them to be writing them, about a
    guy in Athens on his way through town to catch a plane out of town, he
    remembers a friend who died, and he has a vision, and it affects his day
    in a significant way, and so, so far I've got about six songs... Anyway,
    it's called Aisle, it takes place in a grocery store." --- Olde Club,
    Swarthmore, April 21, 2001

[^storeseries]:
    Store is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^choir]:
    In the [hierarchy of
    angels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_angelic_hierarchy)
    described by theologian Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and later
    criticised or incorporated into the theology of many other Christian
    theorists, a choir is a division of angels corresponding to a particular
    rank (for example, archangels are in a higher choir than angels, as are
    seraphim). This can also refer to a literal choir, such as the angels who
    sung at the birth of Jesus:

    Suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel,
    praising God and saying:

    Glory to God in the highest heaven, \\
    and peace on earth to people He favors!

    The head of the heavenly chorus could thus refer to the highest ranking
    angel or to the leader of a literal choir of angels. Both of these could
    describe [Lucifer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer), who often
    considered to be the highest angel prior to his rebellion, and is also
    sometimes interpreted to have lead the angels in song. However, this
    allusion could be unintended, and the narrator sees his friend not as
    Satanic, but as the leader of a beautiful, angelic choir.

## Straight Six [^sixseries] [^engine] ## {#six}

Dull powder-blue paint job, Earl Scheib special [^scheib] \\
Dashboard full of talismans to try and push fate \\
Rabbit skull hanging from the rearview \\
Six kicking cylinders lined up straight

And I ride \\
And I glide down the streets of this city \\
All night, up tight \\
Jenny's [^jenny] on the cellular high as a kite

There's a crack in the windshield eighteen inches long \\
Evaporating snow forming crystals on the chrome \\
Brand new battery I shoplifted from the Pep Boys [^pepboys] \\
Cold cranking power to bring me on home

And I ride \\
And I glide down the streets of this city \\
All night, up tight \\
Jenny's on the cellular high as a kite

Sometimes \\
The moon shines \\
Like a beacon to the weary and sick in spirit \\
And sometimes, sometimes it's dark

    Straight Six is part of the [Jenny series](series.html#jenny).

[^engine]:
    A [straight six engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-six_engine)
    is a car engine in which six cylinders are aligned in a single row driving
    a single crankshaft, as opposed to a V6 engine, in which the six cylinders
    are in two rows of three. The main advantage of this design is reduced
    engine vibration compared to a V6, however, the reduced space requirements
    of the V6 has led to its widespread adoption over the straight six. This
    implies that the narrator is either driving an older car, one of a few
    pickup, or one of even fewer modern cars.

[^scheib]:
    [Earl Scheib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Scheib) was an automobile
    paint and repair company with locations throughout the United States
