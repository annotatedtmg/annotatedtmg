    Prior to releasing the album, John made this post on the Mountain Goats
    front page:

    > Hi everybody. Hope you have all been well and are keeping warm as the
    > colder months close in. So yeah: as you may have learned yesterday, we
    > spent much of 2010 inside recording studios, safe from the vitamin-giving
    > rays of the sun. I wrote a bunch of new songs, and then we recorded them
    > all and set some aside because they didn't quite fit in with the others,
    > and then there were thirteen survivors when we were done, which are now
    > ready to claw their way to the surface.
    >
    > The album is called ALL ETERNALS DECK, and if you have ever watched say a
    > 70s occult-scare movie where one of the scenes involves a couple of people
    > visiting a storefront fortune teller, getting their cards read, and then
    > trying to feel super-hopeful about what they hear when what they're
    > visibly actually feeling is dread, then you have a pretty decent idea of
    > what the album is all about. If you know the feeling of exultation that
    > comes with having recognized the oncoming train of fate, then that's the
    > other thing the album's about. JD, wouldn't it be easier to write an album
    > of, like, love songs? Probably, I would not know, my focus is mainly death
    > scenes and downtown Portland. It's not like there aren't people in love
    > either dying or getting arrested at 3rd and Yamhill, so really, if you can
    > stretch your definition of "love song" we can all be happy. Other possible
    > points of reference include Burnt Offerings, Go Ask Alice, and that one
    > scene in The Warriors where they're on the train and the sun's coming up
    > and they're safe but you know the scars are permanent now. Reversals of
    > fortune and faces at the window and sudden unexpected screams of triumph
    > here and there. Possible exits from the long-locked basement. These sorts
    > of moments.
    >
    > As with the last album, we treated the recording sessions as commando
    > raids on several studios with a few different producers: at Fidelitorium
    > with John Congleton; at Q Division with Brandon Eggleston; at Mission
    > Sound with Scott Solter; and, as I said yesterday and am still jumping up
    > and down about, at Mana Recording Studios with Erik Rutan. The album's
    > coming out on [Merge](http://mergerecords.com/) in the U.S. on March 29th,
    > 2011; [Moorworks](http://www.moorworks.com/) has got it for Japan, and our
    > good friends at [Remote
    > Control](http://blogrc.remotecontrolrecords.com.au/) in Australia are
    > holding it down down under, and will release it on March 26th. I hope we
    > get to tour all those places and more next year!
    >
    > Here are the songs on *All Eternals Deck*. Their names, I mean. It would
    > be totally premature to just post all the songs. See you soon!
    >
    > 1\. Damn These Vampires \\
    > 2\. Birth of Serpents \\
    > 3\. Estate Sale Sign \\
    > 4\. Age of Kings \\
    > 5\. The Autopsy Garland \\
    > 6\. Beautiful Gas Mask \\
    > 7\. High Hawk Season \\
    > 8\. Prowl Great Cain \\
    > 9\. Sourdoire Valley Song \\

    On the album as a whole:

    > A lot of ghastly things and crystal-ball symbolism run through it, but

    "For me, every album is a concept album --- whether you're spelling out a
    story or not, it's whatever mood you're in when you're making the record.
    I think there's an idea of luck that tends to run through my stuff, the
    idea that you construct your own fate but you don't get to look at it
    until after you've already been through it. That's the heart of tragic
    vision, of Sophocles, who was sort of my muse: Our fate is not
    predetermined, but you will go through stuff because of the nature of how
    you are, and you don't know what that fate was until you've come through
    the fire. It's about coming to terms with your doom."

### Liner notes [^japanese] ### {#liner}

*(sleeve):*

the Mountain Goats thank all named above plus Alyson, Juan, Jacob, Adam,
Boche, Mac, Laura, and Hate Eternal [^hateeternal]

The *All Eternals Deck* predates Crowley's [^crowley] tarot [^tarot] by at
least ten years; [^thoth] its earliest known issue arises three months after
the first recorded appearance of the Inhuman Impulse Deck,[^inhuman] to which
it owes stylistic debt. Beyond these few details, its exact provenance is less
certain. The two differ in several ways: the IID was printed on rough stock in
purple and black ink, the AED in full color on gloss; both decks are printed
on stock sourced from the same supplier, but the former's press can't be
identified, whereas the latter's has been positively traced to a
pre-Depression print shop in Oklahoma City; the IID's instructions offer only
one layout, the AED's three; etc.

The IID was a "trade" deck, sold by card-readers to other card-readers and to
readers-in-training. It did not circulate among the general public. The AED,
known to have been commercially available in various locations across the
U.S., England, and in places farther afield (two decks, both heavily used,
were found several years ago in Poland), may have been marketed to families as
a parlor game, or to collectors of spiritualist arcana. The numbers in which
it circulated are not known and estimates vary widely.

The cards themselves are derived from a common source (see several nearly
identical cards, e.g. the Rose, the Cave-Dweller, and the Sick Twins[^cards])
but seem to have been drawn by different artists. The IID's drawings are less
detailed than its successor's. The AED is also more hopeful than its
predecessor, which may account for its wider reach; even its least favorable
readings can be left open to more cheerful interpretation. It shies away from
calamity. The IID, on the other hand, was almost unique among fortune-telling
devices in that it freely predicted dire consequences and unhappy endings.

While the original plates for the AED have been lost, secondary plates were
struck in 1951 using careful tracings of the originals as models, and these in
the main are the cards that have come down to us. Several copies of the deck's
original instructions, which came tucked into the pack in the form of a
miniature 12-page pamphlet in small type, remain in the hands of private
collectors; they refer to a card called the Half-Dragon, which is not found in
any surviving or catalogued copy of the deck.

[^japanese]:
    All Eternals Deck was released in Japan with markedly different liner
    notes, as [mentioned above](#related). Unfortunately, I haven't been able
    to find someone to translate these - if you'd like to do so, please [let
    me know](../about.html#contact)! You can see the [Japanese liner notes
    here](mirror/aed-japanese-liner.html), thanks to the transcription efforts
    of [Andrew Fazzari](http://www.andrewfazzari.com/) and some partial
    translation by Flynn Germain.

    Similarly to the liner notes for [On Juhu Beach](juhu.html), which were
    translated into Japanese by Kazuharu Miyagawa, a member of the postrock
    band Jamaican Cheek, the Japanese text in All Eternals Deck was written
    and translated by Tooru Yamamoto and Hiroaki Sakai, two members of the
    indie band [moools](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moools). They mention
    that they added some explanations, so I'm curious what's in the text.

    Additionally, there are mentions of Burnt Offerings and Logan's Run,
    presumably related to [High Hawk Season](#hawk), and items from the
    Mountain Goats, Superchunk, and Extra Lens discography. We'll need to
    translate the liner to find out more, so if you can help with that, please
    be in touch!

    The Japanese edition also includes a page showing the discography of the
    Mountain Goats, beginning with Taboo VI: The Homecoming in 1991 and ending
    with All Eternals Deck in 2011. Notably, it includes Hail and Farewell,
    Gothenburg in 1995, listing it as "Unreleased". I am not aware of any
    other place where John has acknowledged this album as an official part of
    the Mountain Goats canon. Jack and Faye, for instance, is not listed,
    perhaps because it only included full-length albums.  Transmissions to
    Horace, Taking the Dative, and Yam, the King of Crops, were also not
    listed, while Come, Come to the Sunset Tree was --- an altogether strange
    list.

[^hateeternal]:
    [Hate Eternal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_Eternal) is a
    Florida-based death metal band. Erik Rutan, the group's frontman, helped
    record All Eternals Deck. Interviewed about the record, Rutan explained:

    > That was one of the best experiences of my career! They're great guys,
    > talented musicians, and it really challenged me, because it took me out of
    > my comfort zone. The Mountain Goats are completely different from what I
    > usually do. John was a fan of Hate Eternal and Morbid Angel, and he said
    > he got the idea to contact me and see if I wanted to produce some songs
    > after seeing a video of me working in my studio. I produced four of the
    > sixteen songs on that album, and one of the songs that I did ended up
    > being the single --- they played it on the David Letterman show! And I
    > remember seeing articles where they're talking about working with a death
    > metal producer, and it was this big hoopla, you know --- "Are the Mountain
    > Goats Making a Death Metal Record?" --- and I think John kinda ran with
    > it.  Seeing my name mentioned in any of those kinds of publications was
    > kind of ridiculous, you never expect that, but the whole thing was a great
    > learning experience for me, and I would work with them again in a
    > heartbeat.

    And in another interview:

    > *Interviewer*: I saw a few years ago you produced The Mountain Goats and
    > then an Agnostic Front record. I think it's cool that you don't just stick
    > to one thing. A person can't just stay put, you have to evolve and stay
    > moving.
    >
    > *Erik*: Yeah, and when I think about death metal and all the bands I've
    > produced, there are still bands I'd like to work with. The thing about
    > other types of music is that it really challenges you. It's a whole
    > different perspective. So I try to approach each album I do individually
    > and try to make it have a unique sound to it rather than just making it
    > the same.  Growing up in New Jersey I grew up around Agnostic Front and
    > back in Ripping Corpse we did a lot of shows with Sick of it All and
    > Biohazard, a lot of hardcore. So I did a record \[Empire\] and an EP
    > \[Rebellion EP\] with Madball, I did the Agnostic Front record \[My Life
    > My Way\] then I did The Mountain Goats\[(four songs on All Eternals
    > Deck\]. That was an awesome experience and learning experience as well.
    > John \[Darnielle, Mountain Goats
    > writer/composer/guitarist/pianist/vocalist\] is a super talented guy, the
    > rest of the guys as well. So that was just awesome to do. It's a different
    > style of music so it requires a different focus. If you listen to any of
    > the albums I've done in my whole career, it's always been challenging. So
    > I guess I just like to challenge myself to be better all the time. I want
    > to be better at what I do and be a better person period.

[^crowley]:
    [Aleister Crowley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley) was an
    English occultist. He founded the religion and philosophy of Thelema,
    identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into
    the Æon of Horus in the early 20th century. Crowley created the [Thoth
    tarot deck](#fn:thoth).

[^tarot]:
    [Tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot) is a type of card deck
    both originally and presently used for card games. However, occultists
    began to use tarot decks for divination in the late 1700s, and they are
    primarily used for this purpose in the English-speaking world. Tarot decks
    have suits (which vary), cards 1 through 10, face cards, and a joker in
    the form of the Fool.

    Jean-Baptiste Alliette was the first to revise this standard deck for the
    purpose of occult divination, developing a 78 card deck based on the Book
    of Thoth, the Egyptian ibis-headed god of wisdom.  This deck is divided
    into two components. First is the Major Arcana, which has no suit and
    contains the Chariot, Death, the Devil, the Emperor, the Empress, the
    Fool, the Hanged Man, the Hermit, the Hierophant, the High Priestess,
    Judgement, Justice, the Lovers, the Magician, the Moon, the Star,
    Strength, the Sun, Temperance, the Tower, Wheel of Fortune, and the World.
    Second is the Minor Arcana, which is split into four suits (swords, wands,
    coins, and cups), each of which contains the ten numbered cards and the
    King, Queen, Knight, and Jack face cards. This modified form persists
    through many modern tarot decks.

[^thoth]:
    Crowley's [Thoth tarot
    deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoth_tarot_deck) was created between
    1938 and 1943, but was not published until 1969.

[^inhuman]:
    Inhuman Impulse, to the best of my knowledge, is neither a Tarot Deck nor
    a reference to anything else in particular.

[^cards]:
    As far as I can tell, none of these cards have basis in real tarot.

[^bookletimages]:
    Each of the following lines were in white-on-black text in front of a
    corresponding image. Although allusions to some songs appear clear (such
    as "damn also their friends" with [Damn These Vampires](#vampires)), there
    does not seem to be any key which conclusively pairs lines with individual
    songs, although there are 13 lines and 13 songs. I therefore cast aside
    speculation and allow the reader to determine any connections themselves.
    All of the images are black-and-white. Several images are of static with
    no text above them.

    There does seem to be a kinship between this image-poem and the ones seen
    in the [We Shall All Be Healed microsite](wsabh.html#microsite),
    particularly in Camera and Book, although truly the connection is
    throughout the entire site.

[^revolver]:
    Backed with an image of a revolver, a person's finger on the trigger.

[^hearts]:
    Backed with an image of the two of hearts.

[^hair]:
    Backed with an image of the upper right part of a person's head with curly
    hair, their right eye looking up.

[^hands]:
    Backed with an image of two hands holding each other, one with long nails.

[^skulls]:
    Backed with an image of two skulls.

[^toothedgasmask]:
    Backed with an image of a gas mask which has an upper row of teeth on the
    bottom.

[^twobodies]:
    Backed with an image of two floating bodies facing away from the viewer,
    one apparently heading downward, the other upward.

[^expiation]:
    'Expiation' simply means the act of righting a wrong, atoning for a sin,
    or similar (from 'to expiate', a synonym of 'to atone'). While I've been
    unable to find any practice which uses the term 'expiation candle', this
    may refer to [votive
    candles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votive_candle), candles lit as
    offerings, usually in a church (but potentially at home or elsewhere), to
    symbolize prayers made for one's self or another.

[^reachinghand]:
    Backed with an image of a hand reaching towards the viewer.

[^crowd]:
    Backed with an image of a crowd.

[^palmtree]:
    Backed with an image of a palm tree.

[^regression]:
    [Past life regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_life_regression)
    is a spiritual technique in which one individual hypnotizes another to
    recall memories of past lives. Such practices presume the existence of
    reincarnation and or some other mechanism by which a persistent spirit
    could experience multiple incarnations. The practice --- at least, under
    this term --- is strongly related to the spiritualist and occultist
    movements in the late 1800s, and presently to the New Age movement.

[^roses]:
    Backed with an image of roses, the same image as on the cover.

[^tower]:
    [The Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tower_(Tarot_card)) is a
    card in the Major Arcana of typical divination tarot decks. It is
    associated with danger, sudden change, and catastrophe. The card usually
    depicts a tower in flames, being struck by lightning, and people falling
    from it. The card is the 16th of the Major Arcana, following The Devil.

[^splitimage]:
    Backed with a split image of --- potentially --- hands on the bottom with
    long nails, almost talons, and something on the top hard to identify.

[^carousel]:
    Backed with an image of what might be a horse from a carousel.

[^biedermeier]:
    Unlike [the other](#fn:aed) [tarot decks](#fn:inhuman) referenced in the
    liner notes, the Biedermeier Jóskártya tarot deck is a real Hungarian
    tarot deck. Specifically, these instructions are from the preface of the
    36 card Cigány Kártya deck (literally, 'Gypsy Cards'). The English
    instruction preface reads as follows:

    > Playing cards have been used for the purposes of fortune-telling since
    > they came into existence some six centuries ago. Indeed, cartomancy is the
    > most widespread technique of foretelling the future.
    >
    > Recent years have seen a notable revival of interest in cartomancy. Two
    > factors account for this trend:
    >
    > First, mankind has always had a hankering for knowledge of what the future
    > has in store not merely out of curiosity but often for immediate practical
    > reasons, as a guideline in making important decisions.
    >
    > Second, in the early stages of his evolution man possessed a far more
    > highly developed intuitive sense than today. Many people are now
    > rediscovering that faculty as they explore their own inner selves.
    >
    > Fortune-telling cards with their evocative yet enigmatic images are
    > signposts on the path to the inner self. Merely by focusing on our
    > subjective perceptions we regain an awareness of an intuitive
    > understanding which has long since been suppressed by the technological
    > superficiality and the hectic pace of modern-day life.
    >
    > It should be added that cartomancy also possesses a high degree of
    > entertainment value. Yet this is not to deny the possibility that the
    > cards may reveal a great deal of truth. It is left to the discretion of
    > the individual to decide how much trust he or she places in what the cards
    > have to say.
    >
    > Herein lies the true fascination of cartomancy: it opens up a new approach
    > to human understanding without prescribing literal conclusions.

[^valentine]:
    [Jean Valentine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Valentine) is an
    American poet and former New York Poet Laureate. Her poem Diana references
    the Roman virgin goddess of hunting and the moon, who was seen bathing
    naked by Actaeon while hunting. As he stared, she cursed him to be mute,
    or be changed into a stag, so that he might never tell anyone about her
    nudity. However, he called out to his fellow hunters, and immediately
    became a stag and was devoured by his own hounds.

    The poem in full is as follows:

    > The tab on the tea bag said \\
    > "Love what is ahead \\
    > by loving what has come before." \\
    > But what came before was no dream \\
    > you wake from, it was human sacrifice: \\
    > Diana was herself, and Actaeon, who saw her naked, \\
    > and the stag he was turned into \\
    > (who was God) \\
    > and the blind dogs \\
    > and the death of God \\
    > "for the sin of seeing." God \\
    > still childbearing, naked, seeing. \\
    > Do we get another life? *Oh yes.* \\
    > *Maybe not in this place. Maybe in different forms.*

## Damn These Vampires [^vampiresjohn] ## {#vampires}

Brave young cowboys [^rockyhorror] \\
Of the near northside [^nearnorthside] \\
Mount those bridge rails \\
Ride all night \\
Scream when captured \\
Arch your back \\
Let this whole town hear your knuckles crack

Sapphire Trans Am [^transam] \\
High beams in rain \\
Drive wild broncos \\
Down the plain \\
Push up to the corner \\
Where the turbines hiss \\
Someday we won't remember this

Crawl 'til dawn \\
On my hands and knees \\
God damn these vampires [^damnvampires] \\
For what they've done to me

Tie those horses \\
To the post outside \\
And let those glass doors \\
Open wide \\
And in their surface \\
See two young, savage things \\
Barely worth remembering

Feast like pagans \\
Never get enough \\
Sleep like dead men \\
Wake up like dead men \\
And when the sun comes \\
Try not to hate the light \\
Someday we'll try to walk upright

Crawl 'til dawn \\
On my hands and knees \\
God damn these bite marks \\
Deep in my arteries

Crawl 'til dawn \\
On my hands and knees \\
God damn these vampires \\
For what they've done to me

[^vampiresjohn]:
    "This is a song about how a person will sometimes come to your house that
    wants to stay there for a long time, and is kind of a thief, and he's only
    your friend if --- you know what, I had a guy, I knew a guy when I was a
    teenager who would show up at the party and you didn't really want him to
    be at the party. Yeah, he would never leave, but he was sort of always
    there so it was like leaving and arriving were sort of not really issues
    with this guy. And one of the Shumpert brothers, our friends, named him
    Wonder Buddy, and explained it as follows: 'Cause you wonder, why is he
    your buddy?' I really loved that. This song is about, like, the more
    dangerous version of Wonder Buddy, like, Danger Wonder Buddy Mark 2,
    right, when he figures out that to really maximize on his oppression he
    has to start actually stealing stuff and/or harming people and/or kiting
    checks." --- El Rey, Los Angeles, June 23, 2011

    "This is a song also about being in the middle of something that you know
    you are going to have to finish walking through, like one of those people
    in the movies walking through a fire, only it's not a movie, it's your
    actual life, and it really feels like real fire." ---Rhino's Youth Media
    Center, Bloomington, June 26, 2011

    "I haven't figured out what exactly to say about it that is true and at
    the same time not over-long and ridiculously self-congratulatory. This is
    a song about a couple of people who are not quite clear how to stop
    damaging themselves, but they sure do enjoy their present condition." ---
    Bowery Ballroom, New York City, retrieved November 26, 2015.

    "This is a song about your friends who seek to drain you of your
    life-force. They're still your friends, but they need your life-force. It
    can be hard navigating --- I say navigating, but I mean even establishing
    --- the boundaries of friendships like these, because certain things in
    these friendships are not navigable. One, you have life-force, two, your
    friends need it to survive." --- Asbury Hall, Babeville, April 6, 2016.
    See also College Street Music Hall, New Haven, April 2, 2016.

    "This is a song about how sometimes you wish to curse all of the
    vampires." --- Wexner Center, Columbus, April 11, 2011

    "... I didn't go crazy, nobody --- I didn't, I spent zero nights in jail,
    it's all good. Unlike the John in this song." --- Bowery Ballroom, New
    York City, March 29, 2011. Additional confirmation that this song is
    autobiographical is in William Caxton Fan Club, [My favorite song of yours

    The song is linked to Steal Smoked Fish:

    > The "Steal Smoked Fish" line is a reference to "Damn These Vampires" line,
    > I'd think. The latter, earlier song is an exaggerated, romantic picture of
    > the people in the song. The former, latter song is a clear-eyed view of
    > the same people. There are no actual vampires.

    In an interview about All Eternals Deck, John referenced the George A.
    Romero film [*Martin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_(film)):

    > There's the George Romero movie *Martin*. It's about a guy who's a
    > vampire --- or maybe he's not a vampire. Maybe he's just crazy. Yeah, he
    > drinks blood. But maybe he doesn't actually need blood. Maybe he's just
    > someone with uncertain motivations. That's the beauty of Martin.

    It's unclear if this directly inspired Damn These Vampires.

[^damnvampires]:
    Regarding this line and its parallel in Steal Smoked Fish (also discussed
    [above](#fn:vampiresjohn)), my friend and
    theologian J. R. Daniel Kirk asked John about the distinction. The
    conversation proceeded as follows:

    > *Kirk*: Alright @mountain_goats Which is it? "God damn these vampires" or "God
    > bless all vampires every night"? My prayers are so confused.
    >
    > *John*: @jrdkirk we travel great distances in our faith journeys n'est-pas

    >
    > *John*: @jrdkirk (the direct answer is that the damning speaker is me in 1986. the
    > blessing speaker is the person I became.)

    His article on the theological issues in Mountain Goats songs is worth the
    read.

## Birth of Serpents [^serpentsjohn] [^serpentsseries] ## {#serpents}

Let the camera pull back \\
'Til the fullness of the frame is clear and plain \\
Peer into the screen until you see it all \\
Like a vision in a crystal ball \\
Let it all fill with smoke \\
Is this somebody's idea of a joke

Let the fixer work [^fixer] until the silver's washed away \\
And take the picture from the tray \\
Look hard at what you see and then remember you and me \\
And let the truth spring free \\
Like a jack-in-the-box \\
Like a hundred thousand cuckoo clocks \\
From the Oregon corners \\
To the Iowa corn \\
To the rooms with the heat lamps \\
Where the snakes get born

Crawl through the tunnel and follow \\
Follow the light northwest \\
See that young man \\
Who dwells inside his body like an uninvited guest \\
See the tunnel twist \\
Clutch your birthright in your fist

Let the camera \\
Do its dirty work down there in the dark \\
Sink low, rise high \\
Bring back some blurry pictures to remember all your darker moments by \\
Permanent bruises on our knees \\
Never forget what it felt like to live in rooms like these \\
From the California coastline \\
To the Iowa corn \\
To the rooms with the heat lamps \\
Where the snakes get born

    "OK, so I'm in Portland, Oregon, which is a very strange place for me to
    go, right, I had what I, I mean, I assume everybody in the world has a
    dark year, at least one, you know, where you go, 'Wow, it's very hard to,
    like, the things that are redeeming about those years become triply
    precious because they were so redeeming compared to the other stuff going
    down.' And Portland was like that for me. It was a lot of rain, a lot of
    darkness, a lot of hard times, but at the same time there were like
    moments of tremendous sweetness that I managed to pull up from all that.
    But every time I go back there it just feels like this haunted landscape,
    you know, it's like, 'Oh my God, there's one corner where I did something
    I hope never to remember, but I do', right. And it's like every fucking
    corner is like that for me. And, you know, from 6th and Yamhill all the
    way on out to 13th and Taylor is some hard times, and I went on this long
    walk, and I have to cut a very long story short, I got a haircut, asked
    the hairdresser if he knew a guy I used to know, and he did, he said that
    yes, Quinn still works at Escape from New York Pizza in northwest.
    'Really, like seven blocks from here, right?' 'Yeah, yeah, you can walk
    there!' 'OK, well, cool.' And I walked down to Escape from New York and I
    walked in, 'Can I help you?' I said, 'Well, I'm not really hungry, can I
    get, like, a lemonade', and I say in my heart, like, Quinn's there, I'm
    gonna say hi to Quinn, my friend from the 80s, a wildfire drag queen
    champion of the city.  And a sweet, sweet, person. And I say, "Yeah, is
    Quinn working tonight?" and the guy looked at me like I had stepped out of
    a spacecraft, and said, 'Quinn?' 'Yeah, yeah, Quinn Richards.' And he said
    'No, no, Quinn died just last year. He made it through the AIDS epidemic
    but he got hit by a car in front of the Plaid Pantry." And I walked home
    with a --- in a really strange mindset. And I had this title sitting
    around for a long time, I slept for two hours and I woke up and I wrote
    the lyric and put it to bed for three months, and when I woke it back up
    this is the song that came out." --- Cat's Cradle, Carrboro, April 8,

## Estate Sale Sign [^estatejohn] [^estateseries] ## {#estate}

Crude little wooden idols \\
And aviator shades \\
The trinkets and the treasures \\
We brought back from the crusades

Some guy in an Impala [^chevyimpala] \\
Shakes his head when he rides by \\
But I remember when \\
We shared a vision, you and I

Worked hard to build this altar \\
We made it earn its keep \\
The cracks across its surface \\
Spiderweb while we're asleep

The sacrificial stains \\
All spreading out and soaking through \\
But I remember when \\
We kept it pretty, me and you

And high above the water \\
The eagle spots the fish \\
Every martyr in this jungle \\
Is gonna get his wish

Stock shots, stupid stock shots \\
From the Pomona mall [^pomona] \\
Set up like unloved icons \\
Gathering dust up on the wall

From films no one remembers \\
They call down silently \\
But I remember when their names \\
Were dear to you and me \\
Yeah

Pennies on the dollar \\
Everything's gotta go \\
The things that we can't even give away \\
I don't wanna know

Try to see if secrets burn \\
When you hold them up into the light [^drag] \\
I remember when \\
We loved each other day and night

And high above the water \\
The eagle spots the fish \\
Every martyr in this jungle \\
Is gonna get his wish

## Age of Kings [^agejohn] [^ageseries] ## {#age}

Halls of the stone tower in the foothills \\
Why should we hide from anyone \\
Held you in my arms for the first time that day \\
Felt like God's anointed when you didn't push me away

Gold light shining on so many things [^blacklagoon] \\
In the age of kings \\
Gold light shining on so many things \\
In the age of kings

Lean on the concrete walls in shadow \\
Why should we wait to throw the switch \\
Felt your name burning like a tattoo into my skin \\
Rain on the clay tiles all night, your head nestled beneath my chin

Gold light shining on so many things \\
In the age of kings \\
Gold light shining on so many things \\
In the age of kings

In the lost age \\
Where the jewels hide \\
And the sword sticks \\
In the waiting stone [^arthur] \\
Still warm

Small chambers shrinking 'til they vanish \\
Wolves in the hallway gaining ground \\
Reach down to the moment when I should have said something true \\
Shadows and their sources now stealing away with you

Gold light shining on so many things \\
In the age of kings \\
Gold light shining on so many things \\

[^blacklagoon]:
    In early drafts of this song, before it had its full form and intent, the
    chorus went:

    > And it was me and my window and the night sky and the moon \\
    > And the glow-in-the-dark model of the Creature from the Black Lagoon

    As John stated, "I missed the song that could have been, but I like *Age
    of Kings* better."

    The [*Creature from the Black
    Lagoon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creature_from_the_Black_Lagoon) was
    a classic 1954 monster horror film. The film --- and the Creature, also
    known as the Gill-man --- had an enduring cultural impact on film,
    writing, and the public consciousness, visible even more than a
    half-century later in pinball machines, theme parks, and elsewhere. The
    Creature is considered to be one of the classic Universal Monsters,
    joining Dracula, Frankenstein, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, and many other
    famous monsters featured in Universal Studios films from the 1920s through
    the 1950s.

    from the stone in which it is sunk, a feat which can only be performed by
    a true heir of Uther Pendragon, and thus the rightful King of England. (In
    other legends, Excalibur is given to Arthur by the Lady of the Lake.)

[^judygarland]:
    [Judy Garland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Garland) was an
    award-winning American singer and actress, born in 1922 and dying in 1969.
    Her work included playing Dorothy in *The Wizard of Oz* and *Judgment at
    Nuremberg*. During her early years as an actress, she was sexually
    harassed and assaulted by people in the entertainment industry, including
    the head of MGM, Louis B. Mayer, who simultaneously constantly insulted
    her appearance (calling her "his little hunchback") and pressured her into
    plastic surgery and use of prosthetics. MGM pushed her to get an abortion
    that she didn't want in 1941, to use amphetamines and barbiturates to keep
    up with the workload and to lose weight, and controlled her eating so she
    would have the body type they wanted. She eventually progressed to using
    morphine, difficulties with alcohol, and other substances. Her life was
    plagued with multiple suicide attempts, placement in psychiatric
    hospitals, violent relationships, and other tragedies. She died at 47 of
    an accidental overdose of barbiturates.

We hold hands and we jump \\
And as we fall we sing \\
Paupers hammering the walls of the castle \\
Going to meet the king

Never sleep, remember to breathe deep \\
Never sleep, remember to breathe \\
Breathe deep

Crash in from deep space \\
Shot birds falling fast \\
Who will be there to catch us in his jaws \\
When we arrive alive at last

I can't hear you in the dark \\
Wish I knew where you'd gone \\
Know you're there, off in the shadows somewhere \\
Trying to soldier on

Never sleep, remember to breathe deep \\
Never sleep, remember to breathe \\
Breathe deep and breathe humbly \\
Secure your mouthpiece when you can [^if]

Toxic shapes adorn the walls \\
As we rise from our knees \\
Someone's coming to reward us, you wait and see \\
Or crush us both like fleas

People who looked like you

Rise if you're sleeping, stay awake \\

And who's going to blink

Surge forward from Van Cortlandt Park [^vancortlandt] like frightened sheep \\

    I'm not sure whether the other films mentioned are intended to refer to
    High Hawk Season, other songs, or both. [Burnt
    Offerings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnt_Offerings_(film)) is a 1976
    horror film (based on the novel by Robert Marasco) about a dilapidated
    house that rebuilds itself by killing its inhabitants. [Go Ask
    Alice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Ask_Alice) is a 1971 novel which
    purports to be the true diary of a 15 year old girl and explicitly
    discusses drugs (especially LSD), sex, rape, sex work, homelessness, and
    other topics considered taboo (especially at the time). It has been the
    center of multiple censorship efforts. The novel is now generally believed
    to have been written by Beatrice Sparks.

    "That song was the second one I wrote after we moved across town here in
    Durham, right. And our new backyard --- the hawks were landing in it,
    which I suspect they were doing because there were two new cats in the
    neighborhood, right, so they're checking it out. But, if you get more than
    one hawk, like, two hawk sightings in your backyard, in the space of a
    week, for an excitable animal person like me, that means you just won at
    life, you know, everything else is great once I, you know --- I really
    love to have animals in my environment, I would live in a zoo if I could.
    And, but, yeah --- this was this hawk on the back, and my wife knows a lot
    about birds and she was explaining how, you know, it does this --- this is
    not going to translate well on radio but --- they do this thing with their
    necks where they sort of look like they're kind of checking you out and
    they dart their --- and that's because they're getting perspective to
    figure out whether they, how far you are from them, right, in case they
    need to eat you, right. And I thought that was awesome, so I got this

[^psalms710]:
    Potentially an allusion to [Psalms

    > God is my shield, saving those whose hearts are true and right.

And I feel guilty \\
But I can't feel ashamed \\
Prowl through empty fields, great Cain

Rummage through the gutted storehouse now \\
And lick the sweat from my brow

Saw the trucks roll out this morning \\
Not sure when they're coming back again \\
Feel the prickings of my conscience \\
In my chest every now and then \\
Sometimes a great wave of forgetfulness \\
Rises up and blesses me \\
And other times the sickness howls \\
And I despair of any remedy

And I feel guilty \\
But I can't feel ashamed \\

    references](series.html#bible).

[^cainabel]:
    In the Bible, [Cain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel) is the
    eldest of two sons of Adam and Eve. He kills his brother, Abel, in jealous
    anger when Abel sacrifices one of his sheep to please God, while Cain's
    offerings of his crops were rejected. God discovers Cain's murder and
    curses him to wander and that all his crops will fail, simultaneously
    marking him so that no others will harm him. Cain leaves to the Land of
    Nod, east of Eden, where his wife gives birth to Enoch. This story is one
    of the most famous narratives of a brother betraying a brother.

[^khmerrouge]:
    This song takes place during the rise of the [Khmer
    Rouge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge) in Cambodia (see [John's
    explanation above](#fn:cainjohn)), the totalitarian dictatorship which
    controlled Cambodia from 1975 -- 1979. The Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot,
    orchestrated the Cambodian genocide, in which 1.5 -- 3 million people
    (approximately 25% of the Cambodian population) are estimated to have
    been murdered or died as a consequence of Khmer policies. The brutal
    regime committed numerous acts of torture, mass murder, murder of
    religious and ethnic minorities, forced labor and relocation, and purges
    of its ranks, with over 23,745 mass graves having been discovered in the
    years after the regime's fall in 1979 in the Cambodian--Vietnamese War.
    Over 1.3 million people are known to have been murdered by the Khmer
    Rouge, many in mass graves collectively known as the [Killing
    Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge_Killing_Fields). Other
    deaths were the result of famine and preventable infectious diseases
    spread by the Khmer Rouge's extreme and rigid enforcement of
    self-sufficient agrarianism.

    The rise of the Khmer Rouge resulted in part from resentment of the
    US-backed right-wing dictatorship that ruled Cambodia since its coup in
    1970, the widely-opposed Vietnam War, and especially the Cambodian
    Campaign, in which 500,000 tons of bombs were dropped on Cambodia by the
    United States, killing over 100,000 mostly uninvolved Cambodians. This
    destabilization and aggression allowed the Khmer Rouge to position itself
    as a force of anti-imperialism, growing its previously small ranks to a
    significant force.

[^apocalypsenow]:
    A likely reference to a famous line in [Apocalypse
    Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Now), Francis Ford Coppola's
    celebrated film adaptation of Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*, set
    during the Vietnam War. In *Apocalypse Now*, a platoon of US soldiers is
    ordered to assassinate Colonel Kurtz, a presumed insane former US Special
    Forces soldier who now lives as the leader of Degar troops inside
    neighboring Cambodia, where he is worshipped as a god. The events in
    *Apocalypse Now* take place in 1970, during the rise of the Khmer Rouge,
    and so is both temporally and geographically adjacent to the events in
    this song.

    During the briefing of US Army Captain Benjamin L. Willard, the leader of
    the US Navy assassination patrol, his superior officers play him a
    partial recording of Kurtz's radio transmissions, which opens with the
    line:

    > I watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor. That's my
    > dream. Its's my nightmare. Crawling, slithering, along the edge of a
    > straight razor --- and surviving.

    The second recording is:

    > But we must kill them. We must incinerate them. Pig after pig, cow after
    > cow, village after village, army after army. And they call me an assassin.
    > What do you call it when the assassins accuse the assassin? They lie.
    > They lie, and we have to be merciful for those who lie. Those nabobs, I
    > hate them. I do hate them.

    The scene concludes shortly after the famed line, "Exterminate --- with
    extreme prejudice".

    "Neanderthal is this branch of human development that doesn't seem to fit

    this little hook off to the side. For years, the theory ran that
    neanderthal man just went extinct. Either they didn't breed with
    cro-magnons, or cro-magnons wiped them out. We don't know what happened to
    them. This is no longer the operating theory, but it was the one that
    inspired me.

    "There is a William Golding book, *The Inheritors*, which operated on the
    theory that the cro-magnons hunted and killed the neanderthal. To me,
    that's a profound notion --- one race of man hunting the other for sport.
    It's *Planet of the Apes* weirdness. I read these stories about the
    development of the species, and there's interesting scientific stuff about

    to have one dress to share between them as an item of clothing, so he only
    got one day of school when he was a child because when he went they all
    clambered him for his dress. And, he fled, like, a coal mining town, which
    I know sounds like something out of a movie but there's actually people
    who mine coal, and, like, that's some real stuff, right, so he gets out of
    high school and he flees to New York and studies with Strasberg, and says
    to himself,"I'm going to be in the movie business one way or the other.'"

[^charlesbronson]:
    [Charles Bronson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bronson) was an
    American film and television actor, starring in numerous western, war, and
    crime films. He frequently played roles where he fought in gun battles,
    most famously in the *Death Wish* series, where he plays a vigilante.
    Bronson grew up horribly poor, working in a coal mine at the age of 10
    after his father died and occasionally having to wear his sister's dress
    to school as the family didn't have enough money for clothes. He fought
    for the US Air Force in World War II, where he was awarded a Purple Heart.
    In the latter stages of his life, his health worsened, and he stopped
    making films four years before his death in 2003.

[^age]:
    "But by the time he got his break, he was a little older than most leading
    men, so he just never told anybody when he was born. I kind of like
    Charles Bronson for that reason." --- Folk Music Center, Claremont, July
    3, 2012

[^gun]:
    Bronson's most famous role was as the vigilante Paul Kersey in the [*Death
    Wish*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Wish_(film)) series. Many of
    his other roles were as a gun-wielding character.

[^ehrenfeld]:
    Charles Bronson was born in [Ehrenfeld,

## Never Quite Free [^neverjohn] [^neverseries] ## {#never}

It's so good to learn \\
That right outside your window \\
There's only friendly fields \\
And open roads \\
And you'll sleep better when you think \\
You've stepped back from the brink \\
And found some peace inside yourself \\
Lay down your heavy load

It gets all right \\
To dream at night \\
Believe in solid skies \\
And slate blue earth below \\
But when you see him, you'll know

It's OK to find \\
The faith to saunter forward \\
With no fear of shadows \\
Spreading where you stand \\
And you'll breathe easier just knowing \\
That the worst is all behind you \\
And the waves that tossed the raft all night \\
Have set you on dry land

It gets OK \\
To praise the day \\
Believe in sheltering skies \\
And stable earth beneath \\
But hear his breath come \\
Through his teeth [^whistling]

Walk by faith [^corinthians57] \\
Tell no one what you've seen

It's so good to learn \\
That from right here the view goes on forever \\
And you'll never want for comfort \\
And you'll never be alone \\
See the sunset turning red \\
Let all be quiet in your head \\
And look about \\
All the stars are coming out

They shine like steel swords [^twinkling] \\
Wish me well where I go \\
But when you see me, you'll know

    says that you haven't is an asshole of the first order, because you have
    spent many, many days and nights working on this, and maybe money at the
    therapist's office, and maybe you've gone into little dark holes of the
    world, taking all kinds of things to try to be free of this person or
    event... I wrote the song, I had a bunch of titles, I didn't know quite
    how to find a three word title that would describe the content of the
    song, and of course it must have three words because of the OCD, and then

[^betblind]:
    A [blind bet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_(poker)) is a forced bet
    made by players sitting to the left of the dealer in flop poker. Two
    blinds exist --- the small blind, which is placed by the player directly
    to the dealer's left, and the big blind, which is placed by the player to
    the left of the small blind. When betting starts, the player to the left
    of both blinds begins, skipping both blinded players. The blinds prevent
    players from folding without betting and keeps tournament games limited to
    a shorter duration, as players with small stacks will be forced to remain
    in the game.

## Brisbane Hotel Sutra [^brisbanejohn] [^brisbaneseries] [^brisbane] ## {#brisbane}

On the crooked road that took me north \\
And brought me home again [^portland] \\
From the pit of writhing serpents \\
Out to the lion's den \\
Where the labyrinth is lightless \\
And the faithless wander crazed \\
Let the light rise from the darkness \\
Let his name be praised [^psalm113]

From the sunrise of my childhood [^childhood] \\
To its premature demise \\
From my mother's best intentions \\
To my stepdad's seething eyes \\
From the hidden self-inflicted wounds \\
That flowered in later days \\
To the folly of their learning \\
Let his name be praised

In the holes the worms have eaten \\
Through all once-treasured things \\
From the wet mouth of the vulture \\
To the red tips of his wings \\
In the dazed eyes of the penitent \\
Emerging from the maze \\
In his wordless explanations \\
Let his name be praised

[^brisbanejohn]:
    "This is an outtake from All Eternals Deck that I think wound up on the
    Australian issue --- there's a long, boring story about why foreign
    presses get bonus tracks, it's really not very interesting. Though I
    always feel this urge to explain it, on account of I'm insufferable. But,
    this was a song that --- it's one of those that we got really attached to,
    and then it just doesn't fit in with the others, 'cause we dwell really
    hard on sequence, we want --- and we know that we're the only ones who
    care, right, but we still want the songs to be a sequence that if you sit
    and listen to it in that order that it does something, that it coheres as
    a picture somehow. And if there's a song that won't play with the others,
    then no matter how much we like it, it has to go.

    "And this was that one that I wrote --- I mean, it's essentially --- from
    time to time songs will crop up for me that belong on The Sunset Tree,
    right, but not to say they're as good as those or whatever, but they're in
    the same vein, right, they're from that impulse that will never be fully
    settled, right. But, then I don't know where to put them, 'cause they
    don't fit, so they wind up as bonus tracks or just live stuff, and this
    was one that I was sitting in a hotel room in Brisbane, Australia, having
    a wonderful life, being far away from home and playing music for strangers
    in a beautiful country and having a great time, and a mood descended on
    me, and I wrote a lyric, and I looked at it, and I said, 'Well, I don't
    know what to do with that', set it aside for a year or two, and then while
    we were in the studio in Kernersville in North Carolina, we tried it. It's
    called Brisbane Hotel Sutra." --- Old Town School of Folk Music, Chicago,

[^psalm113]:
    The entire structure of these stanzas echo [Psalm
    113:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+113&version=NIV),
    which states, "From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets, /
    the name of the Lord is to be praised." Other stanzas have similar
    phrases, such as [Job
    1:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+1:21&version=NIV):

    > Naked I came from my mother's womb, \\
    > and naked I will depart. \\
    > The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; \\
    > may the name of the Lord be praised.

    although these don't include the "From... to..." structure that John
    emphasizes, including the sunrise and sunset phrasing.

[^childhood]:
    Given the autobiographical nature of this song and its connection to The
    Sunset Tree (see [above](#fn:brisbanejohn)), this clearly refers to the
    abuse John and his mother suffered at the hands of his stepfather,
    resulting in John's drug use and self-harm, chronicled in [The Sunset
    Tree](sunset.html) and [We Shall All Be Healed](wsabh.html), as well as

## Used to Haunt [^hauntjohn] [^hauntseries] ## {#haunt}

Tunnel down to the core \\
Climb through the trapdoor \\
Soft pink sky full of rumpled clouds \\
Radio up loud

There's a pop in the speakers \\
Where I hear your voice come through \\
So brave and true \\
When did I lose sight of you

Come and rattle your chain \\
All you want \\
You're always gonna be welcome \\
Here in the hallways that you used to haunt

Ride the sentimental rodeo \\
Down to where the shadows grow \\
Long while since I felt this way \\
Stand by the window, wait for day
