[^dubie]:
    Nine Black Poppies is taken from the title of a Norman Dubie poem, "Nine
    Black Poppies for Chac", which is also quoted on the back of the booklet:

    *The junta was jubilant around the mortised fountain.* \\
    A solemn procession of century plants going to the bridge. \\
    A dead chauffeur in the ditch. \\
        You thought \\
    you watched a quetzal bird fly from the bursting tin \\
    of gasoline. Nine enemies of the junta \\
    are sprawling in the back of an open wet Mercedes. \\
    You threw your last two paintings into the sea. Looked \\
    for snow on the mountain. \\
    You washed your legs and breasts in a jagged fragment \\
    of mirrorglass. And wrote, *except for the genitals \\
    my body is seamless. I've changed my mind about God again. \\
    I'm tired of the new dress. I'm ashamed \\
    my work hangs in Princeton and New Haven.* \\
    Near the shack your Winchester kicks once --- \\
    in your line of vision the lifting hawk did not drop \\
    for it had eclipsed a crow, your lead passed \\
    through its dark stomach: \\
        the hawk banks to the left, \\
    free falls, tucked \\
    for one complete revolution, then wielding suddenly \\
    onto the immaculate screw of a rising thermal, \\
    it rose a degree or two on the horizon and made \\
    its quick diagonal hit at the neck of the crow. \\
    It only took a moment! You fed the chickens corn, and \\
    threw the Winchester in the ocean. \\
    The dead colonel in the Mercedes wore his winter coat \\
    like a cape, arms absent from the sleeve. For this \\
    you dislike him instinctually. The newspaper talked \\
    about the contents of his mistress' stomach. The colonel \\
    had made a sauteed abalone while issuing camphor and vinegar \\
    to the city's poor to check the typhus. Abalone, like inkfish, \\
    needs prodigious pounding with a pine mallet scented \\
    in garlic. The red foot of this shellfish is butchered \\
    like a steak. When the fat reaches the point of fragrance, \\
    cook two minutes to each side. \\
        *Oh, yes, parsley \\
    to clean the palate first!* \\
    You hoped you had watched a quetzal bird flit \\
    in and out, along side the limousine, \\
    below the green stand of cane... \\
        *a cavity \\
    was cut deep into the colonel's loins, \\
        it was \\
    irrigating pink in the eternal spring rains...*

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

*(inside of booklet):*

Our winter coats useless, it being June in California, tangibly June I mean,
we let them fall. An hour later we came back to look at the same spot but we
had been irremediably changed by then and our coats were gone. In six hours it
would be dark again, and the evening heat would cause the air to swell, and
songs would crackle along the radio signals which raced across the sky, and
we'd be giving each other that look again: the one that almost means what it
says. Almost.

The Mountain Goats are John and Rachel. We wrote these songs except #9 which
is by Refrigerator. Four of them were recorded by Bob Durkee and they were all
assembled by him during the first week of June, 1995. Peter HUGHES sings
beautifully on #1 and Allan CALLACI [^allan] tells it like it is on #9, which
was recorded live via telephone hook up in April on VPRO Radio
Amsterdam. [^vpro1995] Thanks to Craig for kindness in a difficult time.
Thanks to Jason WARE for photography and to Kelly SPIOTTO for graphic design.
Chris, Barbara, Willem: this one's for you. Wow, this is global. [^global]

*(back of booklet):*

You thought \\
You watched a quetzal [^quetzal] bird fly from the bursting tin \\
of gasoline \\
--- Norman DUBIE. [^dubie]

[^vpro1995]:
    John and Rachel performed several times as the Mountain Goats on VPRO, a
    radio organization in the Netherlands. During the first of these sessions,
    which was on April 19, 1995, Allen Callaci called in from his work at the
    Upland Library to perform Lonesome Surprise with the Mountain Goats. This
    recording was used here in lieu of a studio collaboration.

    Later in the record, part of the announcement made by the interviewer
    preceding Lonesome Surprise was inserted before Pure Money.

[^allan]:
    This is a misspelling of his actual name, Allen Callaci. I don't know why
    this wasn't caught; perhaps it was left in to preserve the authenticity of
    the original liner notes. Other misspellings abound in Mountain Goats
    material.

[^global]:
    "Wow, this is global" is a direct quote of Allen's enthusiastic
    exclamation at the end of Lonesome Surprise.

[^quetzal]:
    [Quetzals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzal) are brightly multicolored
    birds found in Mexican and Guatemalan forests. Their name comes from the
    Nahuatl *quetzalli*, which refers to the tail feather of a specific bird.
    Being in Nahuatl, there is potentially a relationship between this
    reference and the [informal series of Aztec songs](series.html#aztec).

[^cubsjohn]:
    John rarely plays this song anymore. As stated at the Bottom of the Hill
    on October 23, 2002, "No, it's not Cubs in Five, because the Cubs have
    broken my heart. Sammy Sosa looks like a guy with stock in the creatine
    people and I'm not saying this just 'cause I'm here, but I'm for the
    Giants, which I'm arguing with my friend Peter about 'cause we're from
    Southern California and you're supposed to be real territorial, but I just
    can't support an American League team in the World Series. And also for a
    while there the Giants had Benito Santiago as catcher, who, you know, he's
    an ex-Cub. And that's how you know they're doomed to lose! You know about
    the ex-Cub factor, right? The more former Cubs you have on your team, the
    worse your chances are in the World Series."

    John jokingly describes the style of Cubs in Five as follows: "All my
    early sets were like that --- I hadn't played any of those songs for
    anybody and so every single one was like, 'Oh yeah, I hope this works out,
    all right, maybe if it doesn't work out so good I'll just hang out on that
    D for a long time! \<strums aggressively\> I think that's how Cubs in Five
    was written." --- Zoop - Farm Sanctuary, New York, June 16, 2007

    When the Cubs were on their way to the [2016 World Series
    ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_World_Series), eventually winning the
    championship in the seventh and last game, it ended a 108 year World
    Series drought, the longest in the history of Major League Baseball. These
    events caused John to give several interviews and write an essay about
    *Cubs in Five*, the meaning of the song, and his feelings about baseball.
    In these excellent reads --- which I'll summarize so you can enjoy them
    yourselves --- he explains how his affection for the Cubs began in the
    third grade, when he was outraged to hear a man abandon his loyalty to the
    team given their losing streak. The song itself originated as he was
    watching a Cubs game:

    > Specifically, I'm on the couch strumming my cheap Korean nylon-strung
    > 3/4â€“size guitar, and at some point, I reflect idly on an on-again,
    > off-again relationship I've been having for the last several years that's
    > given me a great deal of pleasure and at least as much pain.
    > 
    > Presently, I'm hoping that I've emerged from the final "pain" phase of the
    > process (spoiler alert: I hadn't), and I'm kidding myself, as one does,
    > thinking: Well, I'm free of all that now; there's a lot of unlikely stuff
    > that'd have to happen before I'd ever dive back into that radiant,
    > glowing, magnificent ocean of high highs and hurt feelings.
    > 
    > ... Over the years the song's taken on a life of its own: Everybody knows
    > that feeling of the hopelessly doomed vow to renounce something or someone
    > you won't and can't forget. Everybody knows that feeling, because they
    > want what they hope is way over on the usually-only-theoretical other side
    > of it, the undiscovered country that you have to take on faith. When the
    > Cubs win the World Series this year, we long-game fans and hopeless lovers
    > will notch what we've all learned, over the years, is a rare thing in this
    > world: the awaited victory. The W on the flag. The substance of things
    > hoped for.

    31, 2016, which is excellent --- sufficiently excellent that I will force
    you to listen to it by not quoting anything from it.

[^infive]:
    The phrase "Cubs in five" refers to winning the [World
    Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series) in only five games.
    The World Series is structured to have a maximum of seven games, with the
    first team to win four games winning the championship. Thus, "Cubs in
    five" implies that the team would win the World Series with only one loss
    (or tie).

[^canterbury]:
    [The Canterbury Tales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_Tales) is a
    frame tale surrounding a collection of stories written by Geoffrey
    Chaucer, a Medieval poet, in the 14th century. Written in Middle English,
    they are challenging for a modern reader although they are nonetheless
    renowned for being written in what was at the time plain English. They are
    widely acclaimed as some of the best English writing.

[^cubs]:
    The [Chicago Cubs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs) are a
    famously underachieving professional baseball team from Chicago. As of
    2013, they had not won the World Series, Major League Baseball's highest
    championship, in 104 years, the longest championship drought in the
    history of baseball.

[^bucs]:
    The [Tampa Bay
    Buccaneers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers) are a
    professional American football team from Tampa Bay, Florida. In 1995, when
    Cubs in Five was written, they had never won a Super Bowl and were the
    only National Football League team to ever have a winless season. That
    losing streak continued into the next year for 26 straight losses.

[^voicemail]:
    A reference to a voicemail message left for his girlfriend [referenced
    above](#fn:cubsjohn):

    > "Why don't you love me like you used to do?" ran a song on the outgoing
    > answering machine of the person to whom the song was anonymously directed,
    > at whom I was very angry on that day (for reasons lost to history), but
    > with whom I could never stay angry for long, because that's how it is when
    > you're a fan: You keep cheering, even when the circumstances might tell a
    > less devoted partisan to seek out fairer pastures. You play nine innings.
    > You keep hoping.

[^superbowl]:
    In American football, the regular season of the [National Football
    League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League) concludes
    after the last week of December or first week of January. Playing through
    January therefore implies making it to the playoffs and potentially the
    [Super Bowl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl), the championship
    game, which is played in January or February.

[^phillips]:
    I presume that this refers to Philip Morris, now known as
    [Altria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altria), is one of the major
    American manufacturers of cigarettes. They are known for massive lobbying
    against exposing the risks of smoking and for fighting against efforts to
    reduce climate change.

    However, it might also be about
    [Philips](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips), a Dutch electronics
    company which anecdotally caught flak from vinyl collectors for developing
    and releasing the CD. It may also refer to any of a variety of companies
    named Philips. Nall spells this "Phillips" instead of "Philips" in his
    [lyrics sheet][nall], but I don't know that this means anything
    significant.

[^heaven17]:
    [Heaven 17](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_17) are an English pop
    band famous especially for the 1983 smash hit Temptation. Their popularity
    waned after the late 1980s.

## Going to Utrecht [^utrecht] [^utrechtseries] ## {#utrecht}

In the morning I looked down \\
Through the third story window overlooking town \\
Across the water somewhere \\
You were sleeping over there

I couldn't believe it \\
I couldn't believe it \\
Not if I saw it with my own eyes \\
With my own eyes \\
With my own eyes \\
With my own eyes \\
With my own eyes

In the morning I looked down \\
Through the third story window overlooking town \\
And I saw you \\
And I knew you saw me too

I couldn't believe it \\
I couldn't believe it \\
Not if I saw it with my own eyes \\
With my own eyes \\
With my own eyes \\
With my own eyes \\
With my own eyes

[^utrecht]:
    [Utrecht](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht) is a major city and
    provice in the Netherlands.

[^utrechtseries]:
    Going to Utrecht is part of the [Going to ...

## Cheshire County [^cheshire] ## {#cheshire}

When the sun came up \\
I got up \\
'Cause you were saying my name backwards in your sleep again

The field outside was wet and green \\
And the most gorgeous cow I'd ever seen \\
Was coming right at me, right at you

Her udder was fat with fresh milk \\
And her black and white coat was as smooth as silk \\
And in the waning of a long, long year \\
I felt the remnants of last night disappear \\
Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear \\
Disappear, disappear, disappear

[^cheshire]:
    Cheshire County is [a county in
    England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire) on the Welsh border. It is
    also [a county in New
    Hampshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_County,_New_Hampshire).

## Chanson du Bon Chose [^chansonseries] [^chansonyamaraja] [^chansontrans] ## {#chanson}

I saw the sycamore underneath the moon \\
I was waiting for something and you were sleeping out there in the living room \\
And it was 5:16 AM, the air was sharp and cool \\
And I wondered where you'd buried our dark little jewel

And the heat rising in the room \\
I am digging graves \\
I am digging graves \\
And the water boiling on the stove \\
I am digging graves \\
I am digging graves

So I held you close to me \\
I saw the shadows start to gather outside beneath the sycamore tree \\
And something was changing, there was something here entirely new \\
Bursting into blossom inside of us both, with the sun coming up and me holding onto you

And your body breathing on mine \\
I am digging graves \\
I am digging graves \\
And your hands running through my hair \\
I am digging graves \\
I am digging graves

[^chansonseries]:
    Chanson du Bon Chose is part of the [Song for ...
    series](series.html#songfor) and [informal series of alternate
    versions](series.html#demos).

[^chansonyamaraja]:
    An [alternate version](series.html#demos) of Chanson du Bon Chose exists,
    in which John, pretending to be someone else as the band the Yamaraja
    Racers, covers the song himself. The song was released on a tribute tape
    to the Mountain Goats, by an English fan who would prefer not to be named,
    on the Bacchanalian Revel label.

    One other Yamaraja Racers cover exists, [The Black Ice Cream
    Song](zopilote.html#icecream).

[^chansontrans]:
    Chanson du Bon Chose translates from French to roughly Song of the Good
    Thing, which in French would actually be "Chanson de la Bonne Chose".
    Given John's interest in the French writer and philosopher Maurice
    Blanchot (evidenced in the [Nothing for Juice liner
    notes](nfj.html#liner), his
    [Tumblr](http://johndarnielle.tumblr.com/post/55899671711/would-you-talk-about-writing-as-a-process-or-possibly),
    and in interviews), and given that John pronounces his name as "bon-SHOW"
    (see the 2008 WNYC session), this title may be a pun simultaneously
    referencing the aforementioned French translation while meaning Song for
    Blanchot.

## Pure Money [^moneyseries] ## {#money}

*"... lo-fi, we hebben het voortaan maar over, eh --- bi-fi, dat lijkt me maar
het beste."* [^lofitrans] [^vpro1995]

The waves crashed all around and near your body \\
The waves came all over you \\
And I saw the sky reflected on the ocean \\
Deadly blue

Yeah, I used to know you \\
I used to know you \\
I used to know you \\
I used to know you

[^moneyseries]:
    Pure Money is part of the [Pure ... series](series.html#pure).

[^lofitrans]:
    Jon Nall translates this as roughly  "... lo-fi, from now on we'll talk
    about eh --- bi-fi, I think that's better" in his [lyrics sheet][nall].
    During the [VPRO interview](#fn:vpro1995) from which this is taken, the
    interviewer repeatedly asked about the Mountain Goats' lo-fi asthetic. In
    response, John and Rachel denied being lo-fi, stating that they were
    bi-fi, which is both a [brand of German
    sausage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BiFi_(snack)) and John's term for
    what he considers his high-fidelity, low technology approach. The
    interview is phenomenal, go listen to it.

## I Know You've Come to Take My Toys Away ## {#toys}

Sun flashing red and then orange then opting for secession \\
On the day when you come to the door with your terrible confession \\
And I know you've come to take my toys away \\
And I know you've come to take my toys away

Skin flushing red and then glowing when you come inside \\
And the moonlight washing all over you, I have got my mouth open wide \\
And I know you've come to take my toys away \\
And I know you've come to take my toys away

Oh and when it drops you're gonna feel it [^pressuredrop] \\
Oh, oh, yeah \\
Oh, oh, yeah

[^pressuredrop]:
    This is possibly a reference to the chorus of the popular reggae song
    [Pressure Drop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_Drop_(song)) by
    Toots and the Maytals, which contains the lines "I say and when it drops,
    oh you gonna feel it / Know that you were doing wrong".

## Nine Black Poppies [^dubie] ## {#nine}

When I got home I meant to give you some sweet chrysanthemum [^chrysanthemum] \\
The wind chimes were ringing all wrong, and you were standing in the doorway singing along \\
And I tried to remember how nice it had been a long, long time ago \\
But I couldn't remember, I honestly could not remember

And a package came for you today from the Hunan Province [^hunan] \\
The postmark burning jet black in the summer sun \\
Someone was changing, someone was changing from the inside out \\
And I turned around to face you

Sweet peas in the garden were all in full bloom \\
And I thought I heard the traces of an old song murmuring in the room \\
Like a half-remembered conversation, but I let it fall away \\
And then I could not remember, and then I honestly could not remember

And a package came for you today from the Hunan Province \\
The postmark burning jet black in the summer sun \\
Someone was changing, someone was changing from the inside out \\
And I turned around to face you

[^chrysanthemum]:
    [Chrysanthemums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysanthemum) are colorful
    flowers found in Asia and parts of Europe. In parts of China and elsewhere
    in Asia, their petals are used to make a tea.

[^hunan]:
    [Hunan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan) is a province of China in the
    central southern part of the country.

## Stars Fell on Alabama [^alabamaseries] [^jazzstandard] ## {#alabama}

You looked real calm as we made our way up the walk \\
There were lazy kisses and hands brushing and small talk \\
The moon was high, your smooth face was high \\
And the kudzu grew

And the stars fell on Alabama \\
And your eyes filled up with light \\
And the stars fell on Alabama

The warm earth underneath us gave way \\
Dry grass crinkled like paper as the breeze came across the bay \\
Cold clean water nearby glimmered in your eyes \\
And your pistol glistened

And the stars fell on Alabama \\
And your eyes filled up with light \\
And the stars fell on Alabama \\
But if you think I'll take a bullet for you, you're dreaming

[^alabamaseries]:
    While not a true cover, the allusion is strong enought that Stars Fell on
    Alabama is part of the [informal series of cover
    songs](series.html#covers).

[^jazzstandard]:
    Stars Fell on Alabama is not a pure cover, however, it strongly alludes to
    and borrows some storyline and lyrics from the jazz standard of the same
    title, performed by numerous famous artists. Its title allegedly comes
    from the title of a book by American folklorist Stars Fell on Alabama,
    which refers to a particularly astonishing occurence of the Leonid meteor
    shower in 1833.

## Lonesome Surprise [^lonesomeseries] [^vpro1995] [^callaci] ## {#lonesome}

*"All right, hit it."*

*"One, two, three, four."*

Doctor, Doctor, can you help me please? \\
All these pills and problems keep piling down on me [^background]

Here's your lonesome surprise \\
Here's your lonesome surprise \\
Here's your lonesome surprise

*"Go, Allen."*

I had a name, had a place, like the clothes I wear \\
The holes grow everywhere, 'til it's like having nothing at all

Here's your lonesome surprise \\
Here's your lonesome surprise \\
Here's your lonesome surprise

Here's your lonesome surprise \\
Here's your lonesome surprise \\
Here's your lonesome surprise

I walked out of my shower, feeling more wet than baptized

Here's your lonesome surprise \\
Here's your lonesome surprise \\
Here's your lonesome surprise

Here's your lonesome surprise \\
Here's your lonesome surprise \\
Here's your lonesome surprise

*\<cheers\> "Woo, this is global!" "We love you, Holland!" "Allen Callaci
rules!" "Allen Callaci, thank you very much."*

[^lonesomeseries]:
    Lonesome Surprise is part of the [informal series of cover
    songs](series.html#covers).

[^callaci]:
    Lonesome Surprise was originally written by Allen Callaci and performed by
    his band Refrigerator. Callaci, an integral member of the Inland Empire
    music scene from which the Mountain Goats originated, has been a
    longstanding friend of Darnielle and has performed Lonesome Surprise as a
    duet on several occasions, usually over a phone (presumably to recreate
    this spontaneous, amazing moment). See for example the Swedish-American
    Hall, San Francisco, June 28, 2012.

[^background]:
    It sounds here like Allen is explaining what's happening to someone who's
    standing next to him. As best I can tell, he says, "My friend's on a radio
    show --- he called me. Now we're doing a duet from Amsterdam." I could be
    wrong, however, so if you hear something different or know more about
    this, please [let me know](../about.html#contact).
