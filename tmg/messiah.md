Released: 2008 \\
Label: Cadmean Dawn

[^messiahrelease]:
    Released in an extremely limited run of 666 vinyl pressings, which were
    only sold at live shows, and available for download online for free,
    although with a requested donation of either $3.00, $6.66, or $10.00 (the
    congregant, devotee, and acolyte levels). The site was taken down sometime
    in 2010.

    John discussed the release in two news posts, the latter of which is
    excerpted here (but both of which are worth reading):

    > Four songs I recorded by myself with Scott Solter in Monroe, North
    > Carolina, are now available for download
    > [here](http://www.satanicmessiah.com/). The songs will also be available
    > as a limited edition double-7" in a gatefold hi-gloss sleeve, etc., but
    > when I say "limited," I mean it, so please don't hold out for the vinyl;
    > only 665 people will get a copy. (I will be the 666th.) An option to pay
    > me for my work is available at the linked site, but is by no means a
    > requirement prior to download, as that would be weasel business.  You do
    > what you feel. I hope you like these songs; I am fond of them; they remind
    > me of old vanished things. They're yours now! Share as you see fit, but if
    > you wanna point people at the donation pages, I would appreciate that;
    > there's an .rtf file included in the .zip file that encloses the songs, so
    > if you just share the whole thing zipped, you won't need to do any
    > why-don't-you-donate evangelization yourself. But don't let me stop you!
    > The evangelical urge must go forth unchecked if the Word is to be spread
    > far and wide.

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

*(back):*

we will come to know our shapes [^shapes]

*(gatefold):*

"There would be no inner shrine for the priests to go into alone and attend
the image of the god in his 'House of Flame.' [^flame] No darkness, no
mystery, no separating the people from their god."

Winifred HOLMES, *She Was Queen of Egypt*, London, 1959 [^holmes]

*(online):*

All files are available at no cost to the listener; you need not give us your
email address or anything. Donations, however, are greatly appreciated, and,
lest there be any question, are earnestly desired; neither the recording nor
the mastering were free, and this site exists as something of an experiment.
If you choose to accept these songs, please stop by [the collection
plate](http://satanicmessiah.com/) and sow your faith-seed, which, like a
grain of mustard, *et cetera*. [^mustard]

[^shapes]:
    A remarkable similar line to those in [1 Samuel
    15:23](tlotwtc.html#samuel) and [Proverbs 6:27](tlotwtc.html#proverbs),
    however, I'm unaware of a source for them. If you know, please [drop me a
    line](../about.html#contact).

    [AKM Adam](http://akma.disseminary.org/about/), theologian and scholar who
    has written about the Mountain Goats, has this to say about these lines:

    > this corresponds to a great extent to John's recurrent allusions to 1 Cor
    > 13:12, though there's obviously a certain difference (or you'd have made
    > the connection explicit). There's no consistent connection between a Greek
    > word and the English gloss "shape", so the reference is harder to track
    > down. HCSB apparently doesn't use "shape" at all in its New Testament (and
    > none of the OT usages seem to fit Darnielle's usage). Among the candidates
    > in Greek, I'd think first of eikôn (image), then homoiôma (likeness),
    > morphê (form), schêma (form), eidos (form, appearance), but none of these
    > seems just right. Interestingly, though, eidos is what Paul uses in 2 Cor
    > 5:7 when he says "we walk by faith, not by sight (dia eidous)." If that's
    > the clue (and it's tenuous), it would connect us again to the
    > eschatological hope of true seeing, possibly connecting to 1 John 3:2,
    > "...what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this:
    > when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is."
    > And, of course, the transformation motif John alludes to in Phil 3:20-21.
    >
    > While Adventists might connect Sunday worship with the Book of Daniel,
    > there's still no conventional phrase "the sign of Daniel" for which one
    > might look. The closest candidate, to my mind, would be the revelation of
    > the Son of Man in Daniel 7:
    >
    > "As I watched in the night visions, \\
    > I saw one like a human being \[Son of Man\] \\
    >     coming with the clouds of heaven. \\
    > And he came to the Ancient One \\
    >     and was presented before him.  \\
    > To him was given dominion \\
    >     and glory and kingship, \\
    > that all peoples, nations, and languages \\
    >     should serve him. \\
    > His dominion is an everlasting dominion \\
    >     that shall not pass away, \\
    > and his kingship is one \\
    >     that shall never be destroyed. "
    >
    > Even then, there's no "sign" one might recognise. That's the case also,
    > though, for "the sign of Jonah", about which I wrote my first published
    > article, so it probably doesn't make a big difference. If it's not the
    > handwriting on the wall, then Daniel himself might be the sign: the
    > prophet in a foreign country, making his way as best he can, trying to
    > keep faith under hostile circumstances.

    AKM Adam, personal correspondence, April 10, 2016.

[^flame]:
    Egyptian temples were structured in two parts, one being the Great House
    and the other being the House of Flame, with the House of Flame occupying
    the holiest spot. Several prayers mention the House of Flame.

    according to [a blog post on Bear Alley Book's

    an interesting woman who wrote a number of books, directed several films,

    illustrates that God's Kingdom becomes great from small things: "He
    presented another parable to them: 'The kingdom of heaven is like a
    mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. It's the smallest of
    all the seeds, but when grown, it's taller than the vegetables and becomes
    a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.”

## Satanic Messiah [^messiahjohn] [^messiahsongseries] ## {#messiah}

I saw the posters popping up around the city \\
Pale blue and washed-out red \\
I went down to the arena, pushing through \\
Hoping I'd run into you \\
Sweet freshly-scrubbed smell of the crowd \\
All the excitement in their eyes \\
We were all made young when he stepped onto the stage \\
Like an animal escaping from his cage \\
Raise the trumpet \\
Sound the drum \\
He whom the prophet spoke of long ago has come

All of us too dazed to leave when it was over \\
Dawdled by the vendors for a minute \\
Gathered underneath a summer sky \\
I was hoping you'd pass by \\
But though I didn't see you that day or the next \\
I'm pretty sure that you were there \\
Making your way among the young and happy horde \\
Headed down to your reward \\
Raise the trumpet \\
Sound the drum \\
He whom the prophet spoke of long ago has come

[^messiahjohn]:
    It's unknown who this describes, if anyone. Given the proximity of the
    American presidential elections to the release date of this record and the
    similarity of the colors mentioned to those of Shepard Fairey's [famous
    HOPE poster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster),
    it was hypothesized that it was about Obama, which John has definitively
    refuted:

    > ok I really REALLY hate having to do this because it's not my style to
    > join in interpretive discussions of my lyrics, I think it's in poor form
    > to do so, but I simply must say that the song has nothing to do with
    > Senator Obama, who is hardly the first person in history to be so
    > charismatic as to seem messianic, nor with Senator McCain, whose charisma
    > hardly resembles that of the song's protagonist
    >
    > red and blue are common colors for posters everywhere
    >
    > can't really tell where people are getting the notion that the protagonist
    > is necessarily a political figure rather than a religious leader,
    > motivational speaker, etc
    >
    > that's enough outta me but please, be advised that I got better stuff to
    > write about than electoral politics, I said all I had to say on that
    > subject in the song public radio commissioned me to write

    And:

    > Of course there's nothing wrong with people giving readings, if I weigh in
    > it's not to say "stop, here's the answer" - except that, you know, ideas
    > are viral, and with an idea like "John wrote a song comparing Obama to the
    > Antichrist" I'd rather just squash that concept before it gets any
    > traction. People are free to say anything they like, just as I'm free to
    > give my reading, which, pace Barthes, is probably gonna come with an extra
    > bit of authority. Take that, dead French guy!

## Wizard Buys a Hat [^wizardseries] [^wizardjohn] ## {#wizard}

Shuffled up 6th Street [^portland] in the rain \\
Kept my head down as I looked past the people \\
And in the department store \\
I found what I was looking for \\
This is the church, this is the crucible

They come out to Broadway [^portland] and they look for me \\
I'm on the red steps smoking a cigarette \\
Easy to recognize \\
Black bandages on my eyes \\
This is the church, these are the congregants

Sun sets on the broad square and lights come up \\
Feel like this town's gonna put a quick end to me \\
But if I came here to drown \\
I'm gonna take a few people down \\
This is the church, occupied by the enemy

## Sarcofago Live [^sarcofago] ## {#sarcofago}

We were hungry, there was no food \\
We were restless, there were too many things to do \\
So we gathered in a concrete room \\
Eyes up at you

And in a small room in Brazil, we were waiting \\
And in a small room in Brazil, we were waiting

We were howling like dogs \\
We were feeling the full brunt of the age \\
Guys from our neighborhood looking down at us \\
All of you, all of you, rage, rage, rage

And in a small room in Brazil, we were waiting \\
And in a small room in Brazil, we were waiting

[^sarcofago]:
    [Sarcófago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcófago), meaning Sarcophagus,
    was a prominent Brazilian black metal band in the 1980s through early 2000s.

## Gojam Province 1968 [^gojjam] [^riots] ## {#gojam}

Running like a band of angry schoolboys \\
Up and down the well-lit streets today \\
Bashing in the heads of tax collectors \\
And anybody else who's in our way

Bathing in the sunlight that's our birthright \\
Waiting for someone to set the scene \\
Last time he came to town, a few stray coins came raining down [^selassie] \\
We scrambled in the dirt for them, like ants around the queen

We take aim at the dawning day, and we shoot \\
Starving to death, starving to death, for the low-hanging fruit

Then all at once here comes the motorcade \\
Slow and steady down the beaten track \\
And as we're bashing out the windows of the limo \\
We notice there's nobody in the back

And the helicopter lands atop the palace \\
The royal guard assembles at the gate [^palace] \\
The country's gonna burn, and we'll still have to wait our turn \\
Last among contenders of the super-featherweights [^weightclass]

We take aim at the dawning day, and we shoot \\
Starving to death, starving to death, for the low-hanging fruit

[^gojjam]:
    [Gojjam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gojjam) was a province in
    northwestern Ethiopia (now the zones of Mirab Gojjam and Misraq Gojjam in
    the Amhara Region). However, the spelling of Gojam is used in places.

[^riots]:
    As of the 1960s, farming in Gojam was practiced communally, making tax
    assessments difficult and rarely performed. As the government wanted to
    collect taxes, they attempted to assess the value of the land in 1967.
    Gojamie farmers recognized that as the government used taxation to
    determine ownership of land, accepting a single payer of taxes for a
    parcel of land would lead toward the destruction of communal farming. As
    the government refused to communicate with them, they resisted, ultimately
    with violence, leading to deaths on both sides and more as the army became
    involved. Farmers marched into Debre Marqos, the Gojam capital, demanding
    a stop and threatening terrorist actions, leading to more military
    involvement. Rebellion continued from 1968 through 1969, ultimately ending
    when the government ceased taxation. Troops remained in Gojam as of 1970.

    Schwab, Peter (1970). [Rebellion in Gojam Province,
    Ethiopia](http://www.jstor.org/stable/483864). *Canadian Journal of
    African Studies*, 4(2), 249 -- 256.

[^selassie]:
    Given the regal description in this and later stanzas, my best guess is
    that this refers to either [Emperor Haile Selassie
    I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie), then leader of Ethiopia,
    or Dejazmach Tsehai Inqu Selassie, the loathed governor of Gojam. If this
    is intended to describe Emperor Haile Selassie, this would lend an
    additional level of appropriateness to the EP, as Selassie is revered as
    the messiah or as God incarnate by Rastafarians.

    Ethiopia](http://www.jstor.org/stable/483864). *Canadian Journal of
    African Studies*, 4(2), 249 -- 256.

[^palace]:
    Potentially a description of the Gojamie march and protest at the capital
    of Gojam [mentioned above](#fn:riots).

[^weightclass]:
    In boxing, the [super featherweight weight
    class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class_(boxing)) is one of the
    lighter divisions, with boxers weighing under 130 pounds.
