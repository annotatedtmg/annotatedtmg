    "This is a textbook for keeping company with loneliness." --- [Japanese
    liner notes](#liner)

    "Of course it \[loneliness\] has something to teach. A life without
    loneliness is incomplete. The main, most useful thing is the fact that it
    ends. Because it feels like living in a cave you have to get away from,
    right?  It's not something you can get in everyday life. It's like
    something from a totally different time, or another planet." --- [Japanese
    liner notes](#liner)

    John: "After the Sunset Tree, it did very well, we toured a great deal ---
    more than we'd toured in a long time, and stayed out on the road --- and I
    don't generally do any writing on the road and then it became clear to me
    that that's kind of where I live now. And so, but I was home for a little
    while, and my first passes at writing tend to be very intentional, where
    you go, 'Well, I'm going to write an album, and it's going to be about
    monsters, and it's gonna have a song on it called *The Mummy's Hand*,
    'cause that was the best of the Mummy movies', and you sit down, you know,
    'cause these first stabs where you really get the idea first are never
    good, right. Got a good song or two out of it but I didn't really know
    where I was going, and for me, the moment at which it got good was
    actually when I wrote that which was in a Holiday Inn in Pennsylvania
    across the street from the largest shopping mall in the world."

    Peter: "I think the Mall of American is actually bigger, this is the King
    of Prussia Mall."

    John: "It seems like the biggest mall in the world."

    Peter: "It's the worst mall in the world."

    John: "And we were in a Holiday Inn Express for three days with nothing to
    do in between shows, and I woke up and started monkeying around with the
    guitar and sort of found the mood, and I think it had to do with the fact
    that, you know --- I mean, not to be super clichÃ©d and lame about it ---
    but you know, you get very lonesome out there away from your wife, and you
    see people every night, but they're always different people, and there's
    this disconnect that happens, and that song came out, and I said, 'Ooooh,
    there's something in there', you know, and sort of followed that thread,
    and found a couple from a year or so ago that had sort of been waiting
    around to find their friends, you know, and that's what happened." --- BBC

    "The new record, uh, people have been calling it a breakup album, which is
    kind of weird 'cause it's not, uh, but at the same time, uh, I mean, it's
    about solitude, and, uh, which is something I have the luxury of going
    through while I'm on tour. It's a great job, but you spend a lot of time
    by yourself in rooms and if you are a person who, uh, you know, is given
    to depressed states, you can really carve out some little holes for
    yourself, uh, in hotel rooms. And since I'm also a big hypochondriac and
    don't like to hang out with people, uh, that's sort of, it makes me able
    to sort of sink into these depths when I'm out there. Which, usually I
    just sit there and mope and watch Law & Order reruns, but a couple of
    tours ago, I thought, well, you know, I've seen all these episodes of Law
    & Order a bunch of times, and so I started writing in the hotel rooms,
    'cause that had actually worked really well for The Sunset Tree. Four of
    its songs were written on tour, and so, uh, actually, the one I just
    played \[Woke Up New\], uh, was the first one I wrote, in a hotel room,
    when I was working on this record. I wrote it in, uh, Evanston, Illinois,
    at a Hilton Garden Inn." --- KEXP session, August 21, 2006. See also Club

[^hanlon]:
    The boxer depicted on the cover is [Eddie
    Hanlon](http://boxrec.com/en/boxer/12291), a bantamweight and later
    featherweight boxer from San Francisco known as Cute Eddie. The image
    comes from a rare prizefighter boxing card included in Pet Mouthpiece
    cigarettes. It came with a short description, which was as follows:

    > THE PET MOUTHPIECE CIGARETTES \\
    > *Factory No. 171 1st Dist. Cal.*
    >
    > EDDIE HANLON, nicknamed "Cute" by the fight fans during his ring career,
    > was born in San Francisco 25 years ago. He was king of the amateurs
    > before essaying the professional game and soon forged tot he front in
    > the senior division. His ability to cover up by assuming an almost
    > impenetrable crouch made him a hard mark for his opponents and his fast
    > two-handed sallies proved the undoing of many aspirants for championship
    > honors. His twenty round draw with Young Corbett at the height of the
    > latter's career was one of his best performances.

    Given that Hanlon was born in 1885, this description would date the card
    to 1910.

    "You have to put bonus tracks on the Japanese album or they won't buy
    it... The Japanese issue is the only Mountain Goats album to date that had
    a lyrics sheet with it. The lyrics were also in Japanese. I was very
    excited about that, 'cause I can't really check whether they got them
    right or whether, you know, back in the '80s when I got a live Cure VHS,
    there were the lyrics to the Cure songs translated from English to
    Japanese and then back. Well, I know they got all those ones wrong,
    because the lyrics to The Love Cats, it said, 'Ah, we move like caged
    tigers / We couldn't get close to the miss'. The actual lyric is, 'We
    couldn't get closer than this'. So I wonder --- in my heart I wonder, but
    I'll never ask anybody --- what does the actual Japanese in my lyric
    booklet say? On my deathbed, people will wonder what I'm yammering about
    when I say, 'Keeping House lyric booklet, what are the lyric booklet
    Keeping House, Japanese import. Japanese import, Keeping House. Keeping
    House booklet lyric. Booklet Japanese import, Japanese import.' They will
    think I am insane, but really, it will only be that I've been thinking
    about the same thing for forty or fifty years." --- Zoop, Farm Sanctuary,
    New York, June 16, 2007

    Well, now we can know!

    Get Lonely was released in Japan with different all-Japanese liner notes,

## Wild Sage [^sagejohn] [^sagevideo] [^sage] ## {#sage}

I leave the house as soon as it gets light outside \\
Like a prisoner breaking out of jail \\
And I steal down to Business 15-501 [^hwy15501] \\
Like I had a bounty hunter on my tail

And somebody stops to pick me up \\
But he drops me off just down the block \\
And along the highway where the empty spirits breathe \\
Wild sage growing in the weeds

Walked down the soft shoulder and I count my steps \\
Headed vaguely eastward, sun in my eyes \\
And I lose my footing and I skin my hands breaking my fall \\
And I laugh to myself and look up at the skies

And then I think I hear angels in my ears \\
Like marbles being thrown against a mirror \\
And along the highway where unlucky stray dogs bleed \\
Wild sage growing in the weeds

And some days I don't miss my family \\
And some days I do \\
Some days I think I'd feel better if I tried harder \\
Most days I know it's not true

I lay down right where I fell, cold grass in my face \\
And I hear the traffic like the rhythm of the tides \\
And I stare at the scrape on the heel of my hand \\
'Til it doesn't sting so much and until the blood's dried

And when somebody asks if I'm OK [^johnareyouok] \\
I don't know what to say [^imnotok] \\
And along the highway \\
From cast-off innumerable seeds \\
Wild sage growing in the weeds

    "You know, I bet you there's several people in this room who are this
    fellow, and there's several more --- probably most of us --- who know
    somebody who is this fellow, who one day wakes up, and he has a voice in
    his head. And it's hard to live and do your thing when you have a voice or
    two or three running around on a loop in your head." --- 40 Watt Club,
    Athens, Georgia, August 10, 2006. See also Port City Music Hall, Portland,
    Maine, June 8, 2013.

    "Wild Sage was really the first song I ever wrote about mental illness. I
    worked in healthcare... when you work every day in hospitals you can
    become numb to the struggles of the people you're working with, and then
    every once in a while somebody will come in and you'll see maybe that it's
    his fifth or sixth time through, and he's starting to look defeated, you
    know, and it can get to you. And what you do is you try to keep that
    feeling with you when you work so you never forget that you're there to
    help people who are having a hard time helping themselves. This song is
    the, I think, first time I tried to write about that, and it's called Wild
    Sage." --- Merkin Concert Hall, New York, March 24, 2013. See also
    People's Place, Amsterdam, October 13, 2013.

    "But this is true, that the fellow who narrates this song, uh, is losing
    his grip on things as they are. He's going insane, as they would put it.
    And so that's why he feels like he does. He hasn't lost anybody or
    anything like that, uh, he suffers from a sort of solitude that most of
    us, uh, thank God, can only really imagine, uh, so, I wrote this for a lot
    of people that I used to work with, and whom I think of from time to time.
    It's called 'Wild Sage'." --- Amoeba Music, San Francisco, August 22, 2006

    "People keep saying that the new album is a breakup album. I don't really
    know where they got that idea. But at the same time, you don't want to
    argue with people, in case they're fixing to say good stuff about your
    record, so: 'Oh yeah, you like it, and it's a breakup --- oh yeah,
    breakup!  Absolutely.' The fellow in this song is more, uh, breaking up
    with, uh, the basic units of what constitutes him as a person. Uh, he
    hasn't lost anybody except himself, and that's sort of what makes it a
    much more solitary place to be than just your standard
    lose-someone-you-love, 'cause there will be somebody else but you only
    have one brain." --- Club Europa, Brooklyn, September 29, 2006. See also
    Gargoyle, St. Louis, October 23, 2006; Variety Playhouse, Atlanta,

    "And in an oblique sense, this song is kind of about that \[who I am as a
    person\]." --- Bottletree, Birmingham, Alabama, June 22, 2013

    Originally, the song was guitar-based with a strong, more complex
    bassline, but it didn't work when they went into the studio and was set
    aside, potentially to not be recorded. Days later, tired, John attempted
    it on piano, playing it slower due to the fatigue of days of recording,
    and that's what stuck. Old Town School of Folk Music, Chicago, April 20,
    2014.

## New Monster Avenue [^monsterjohn] [^emspace] ## {#monster}

Shadows on the broad lawn, canopy of trees \\
Sometime after midnight the ground is gonna freeze \\
Birds in the frosty air \\
What are they doing there?

Greenhouse full of butcher's-broom [^butchers] [^persian] \\
Breeze is at my back \\
Sometime before the sun comes up \\
The earth is gonna crack

I look down at my hands \\
Like they were mirrors

Fresh coffee at sunrise \\
Warm my lips against the cup \\
Been waiting such a long time now \\
My number's finally coming up

All the neighbors come on out to their front porches \\
Waving torches

    DBS: You've said that *Get Lonely* started as an album of songs about
    monsters. How so? What was the idea there? What was the impetus?

    JD: I don't know what the impetus was other than that I have this real
    love of monsters. A few of the songs from that beginning survive --- "If
    You See Light," which is a riff on the Frankenstein monster hiding in a
    house while the villagers bombard the doors, and "New Monster Avenue,"
    which is sort of the tranquil suburban version of the same thing, only all
    the action's internalized. --- interview with Sam Costello, Dark, but

    "... I had this idea when I was digging through my childhood stuff, I
    remembered how much I really liked monsters. And so I started to write
    these songs about monsters. Mentioned that on NPR and then I got a lot of
    mail, 'So are you still working on the monster concept album?' No. But
    anyway, so, but, but I got a couple of them, a couple of songs about
    monsters done before I found some other direction, but there was something
    in them. There's always something --- you know. I assume you're like me,
    that when you see the monster movie and all the, all the citizens of the
    town, you know, gather to burn the monster alive, you go, 'Were people in
    the '30s in favor of the town, in this setup?' Because I would look at it
    as a kid and go, 'Why, why are they going to kill the innocent monster
    from the depths?' Right? He doesn't --- he was living in a cave under the
    ocean and then one of your people was swimming because you wanted to get
    some underwater footage, and, and now he has to *die* so that you can film
    people swimming under --- well, that doesn't seem right. That was my
    position on the monsters. That remains my position on the monsters. This
    is called 'New Monster Avenue'." --- Amoeba Music, San Francisco,
    CA, August 22, 2006

    "This song is sort of about the feeling you get if you stay in your house
    for too long and you feel like maybe you don't, uh, relate to anybody. At
    all. And you sort of resent them, but you're certain they're going to come
    and get you. I'm here to tell you, you're absolutely right." --- Middle

    This was specifically written for the San Francisco dance company
    [EmSpace](http://www.emspacedance.org/repertory.php) well before *Get
    Lonely* existed conceptually (making it the first written song of those
    which made the album). The company had previously choreographed to several
    Mountain Goats songs in the piece [*Songs for
    You*](http://www.emspacedance.org/rep/songs-for-you.php) in 2004:

    > There's this dance company called EmSpace Dance. A couple of years ago
    > their director, Erin Mei-Ling Stuart, wrote to me and asked whether they
    > could choreograph some of my songs. I love dance, a lot; it makes my
    > hair stand up on end sometimes. Still, a year later, when Erin sent me a
    > videotape entitled Songs For You, I was shocked by how strong my
    > reaction to it was. I feel that in EmSpace's remarkable work, the inner
    > lives of my songs become real and whole. Seeing them dance this piece in
    > June was the single best hour I've spent this year.
    >
    > At the same time, I know not everybody can feel that modern dance
    > groove. So be aware: if you're not familiar with the vocabulary of
    > dance, there's going to be some serious negotiation between you & a
    > dance performance like this, should you go. Having said that: EmSpace is
    > premiering a new piece in October. It's called *New Monster Avenue*,
    > which not coincidentally is the title of the song I wrote especially for
    > them. The song won't be released any time soon, if ever; it's one of
    > the best I've written in the past year.

    The company's short summary of the piece states, "New Monster Avenue treks
    deeper into the emotional landscape created in *Songs For You* by
    revealing the same characters at an earlier point in their lives.
    Featuring more music by The Mountain Goats, including a brand new song
    written for the piece, *New Monster Avenue* delves into the nuances of
    these intense characters and relationships."

## Half Dead [^deadjohn] ## {#dead}

It was raining outside, so I cleaned house today \\
Spent half of the morning throwing old things away \\
Try not to get caught up, try to think like a machine \\
Focus in on the task, try not to think about what it means

Can't get you \\
Out of my head \\
Lost without you \\
Half dead

Took my spot at the window \\
Looked out at the road \\
Dots and dashes of traffic \\
Like a message in code

And whole boxes of memories \\
Wrapped up at the curb \\
I sang songs to myself that \\
Didn't have any words

Can't get you \\
Out of my head \\
Lost without you \\
Half dead

Stole out to the back yard late last night \\
Pine trees frozen in the silvery moonlight \\
Rising like giants from the cold earth \\
What are the years we gave each other ever gonna be worth?

Can't get you \\
Out of my head \\
Lost without you \\
Half dead

    "This is a song about how sometimes you may be running through your books... and you
    may find a bookmark in one of them that may be the ID of a person who is no
    longer in your daily spirit... And you may say to yourself, 'Wherever did
    she go'." --- Club Europa, Brooklyn, September 29, 2006

    "This song wasn't supposed to be there, but it was, like, sort of waiting
    for its chance... \[Peter: "It was the hidden track."\] It was the hidden
    track, but you didn't have to wait an extra twenty minutes to hear it.
    This is a song about a morning that you are gonna have. You'll remember me
    when that morning comes. You'll say, 'Fuck that guy. He told me this shit
    was coming, and here it is. This really sucks. I hate it, and I hate
    knowing that he was right.' But I will take a sort of cynical satisfaction
    in your pain." --- Bowery Ballroom, New York, September 30, 2006

    "This is a song whose explanation is really simple, which I like because
    sometimes I try to explain to people what the songs are about, and it's
    like, 'It's not really like anything in my experience, John, so I don't
    really know what you're talking about.' I say, 'Well, I didn't write it
    for you anyway!' But this one, I don't suppose there's anybody among us
    who hasn't at some point been going through their stuff, cleaning the room
    or looking for something, run across an old student ID of somebody you
    hadn't seen in a long, long time and you say to yourself, 'Well, I
    probably shouldn't keep that, what if my wife runs across it?' 'Why do you
    have that?' 'Well, I don't know, I wasn't saving it, I just didn't know I
    had it still.' 'Well, why didn't you throw it away?' Well, I didn't, I
    mean, there's no reason to really throw it away.' 'Well, why are you
    keeping it?' 'I'm not keeping it, I just didn't really know it was
    around.' That sort of thing. Except subtract the wife and add a lot of
    emptiness in the spaces around the house: in the fireplace, in the
    kitchen, in the bedroom, in all the corners of the bedroom --- it's
    remarkable the amount of emptiness you can fit into one of those --- and
    try emptying the house of the presence of a person who was once there and
    will not be there again, and this is called Half Dead." --- Club Capitol,
    Perth, January 2, 2007

    "So, these aren't the same people \[as in How to Embrace a Swamp
    Creature\], but they could be. You know, you think about that sort of
    relationship where you did the visit back to the house a couple times, and
    as I had warned you --- but you wouldn't listen to me. You thought I
    didn't know. You thought, 'Oh, well, your situation is unique. Dumbass.
    Well, you don't understand the particulars of my situation, I can go over
    to my ex's house, it's all cool.' No, it ain't. But you wouldn't listen.
    So then it got ugly, you know, as it does, and, well now, how do you feel?
    Sad. Then you're like, 'Oh, I wish I had --- the last six months are just
    some, like, meaningless blur of activity that I enjoyed at the time and
    now I'm paying the price for it just like the Holy Mother Roman Catholic
    Church told me that I would pay that price, you know, and now here I am,
    and I'm not even Catholic yet I have to pay it anyway, what kind of
    bullshit situation is that?' Well, that's the situation you bought
    yourself, going against. But anyway. So, yeah. So you find yourself going
    through boxes, and now you're not thinking of taking stuff back, you're
    gonna throw it away. And it's going to cost you. And again, I told you.
    You wouldn't listen. Enjoy." --- Bowery Ballroom, New York, October 1,

## Get Lonely [^lonelyjohn] ## {#lonely}

I will rise up early \\
And dress myself up nice \\
And I will leave the house \\
And check the deadlock twice \\
And I will find a crowd \\
And blend in for a minute \\
And I will try to find \\
A little comfort in it

And I will get lonely \\
And gasp for air \\
And send your name up from my lips \\
Like a signal flare

And I will go downtown \\
Stand in the shadows of the buildings \\
And button up my coat \\
Trying to stay strong, spirit willing \\
And I will come back home \\
Maybe call some friends \\
Maybe paint some pictures \\
It all depends

And I will get lonely \\
And gasp for air \\
And look up at the high windows \\
I see your face up there

## Maybe Sprout Wings [^maybejohn] ## {#maybe}

A bad dream shook me in my sleep \\
And I woke up sweating \\
Ran through the dark to the shower \\
Already forgetting \\
Try to think good thoughts \\
Trying to find my way clear \\
Let the room fill with steam \\
Traced pictures on the mirror

Ghosts and clouds \\
And nameless things \\
Squint your eyes and hope real hard \\
Maybe sprout wings

I clawed my way to the living room window \\
Stood there in the cold \\
The last bits of my dream like figures in the distance \\
Hard to hold \\
I thought of old friends \\
The ones who'd gone missing [^likeyou] \\
Said all their names three times [^bloodymary] \\
Phantoms in the early dark \\
Canaries in the mines [^canary]

Ghosts and clouds \\
And nameless things \\
Squint your eyes and hope real hard \\
Maybe sprout wings

    "This is a song about a guy who has no children, is that close? He has
    none because he is so alienated from his fellow creatures that it really
    wouldn't really do right for him to go and make children yet. That doesn't
    stop a lot of people, but, thank God, it stops our man. He should like to
    know somebody with whom he could have children. But he's fairly well
    convinced that everyone is out trying to kill him. Wish him luck, he'll
    need it." --- The Earl, Atlanta, November 3, 2006

    "This is a song about how sometimes you wake up and you say, 'Oh, I'm
    ashamed', and then you don't really know what it is you're ashamed of. So
    how would you tell anybody about that? You're not ashamed of any
    particular thing, just carrying a general sort of shame. It has its own
    sweetness to it if you live with it long enough." --- Gardner Lounge,
    Grinnell, November 2, 2007

    "We went out to King of Prussia, because it's so picturesque there. A
    romantic place. Many writers go to stay across the street from the
    shopping mall to court their muses there. We had three days in a Holiday
    Inn Express across the street from an extremely large shopping mall in
    King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. I determined after the first trip to the
    shopping mall that it was probably better to stay inside. And that's what
    I did for the next two days, and when Peter would go into the shower, I'd
    write a song. Except that one song I got excited about and I went out into
    the hallway to write it because I couldn't wait for Peter to shower,
    because he had already showered that day, and I thought it would be
    strange to say, 'Peter, would you mind taking a shower?' This one,
    however, was written while Peter was in the shower. Hence its dark mood,
    because I missed him so much." --- Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh,
    September 20, 2006. See also Apolo, Barcelona, October 19, 2013
    (excellent).

    "This is a song for when you, you know, you reach a point in the pursuit
    of solitude where the booze isn't gonna do the job anymore. \[Voice:
    "What!?"\] I know, that's sad news for some of you all, man. But trust me,
    there comes a point, it's sort of like a, oh, what the hell, book or
    movie, I don't know. Some book or movie in which --- oh, 'The Iceman
    Cometh' by Eugene O'Neill... And in this book, in this play, if you
    haven't read it, uh, all these drunks are hanging around at the bar and
    some guy comes in and tells them all that they're never going to make
    anything of their lives and they should stop pretending that they are. And
    then the booze stops working. \[Voice: "What!"\] Yeah. \[Other voice:
    "More booze!"\] No, no. At that point you have to drink your own
    helplessness. It's considerably more costly than booze. This song is about
    drinking your own helplessness, it's called Maybe Sprout Wings." --- The
    Slowdown, Omaha, November 3, 2007

## Moon Over Goldsboro [^moonjohn] [^postcard] [^goldsboro] ## {#moon}

I went down to the gas station \\
For no particular reason \\
Heard the screams from the high school \\
It's football season

Empty lot the station faces \\
Will probably be there forever \\
I climbed over the four foot fence \\
I was trying to sever the tether

Moon in the sky \\
Cold as a stone \\
Spend each night in your arms \\
Always wake up alone

I lay down in the weeds \\
It was a real cold night \\
I was happy 'til the overnight attendant \\
Switched on the floodlight

Walking home I was talking to you under my breath \\
Saying things I would never say directly \\
I heard a siren on the highway up ahead \\
Kinda wished they'd come and get me

Frost on the sidewalk \\
White as a bone \\
Tried to get close to you again \\
Always wake up alone

And as I was crossing our doorstep \\
I hesitated just a moment there \\
Remembered the day we moved into our small house \\
'Til the vision got too vivid to bear

You were almost asleep \\
Halfway undressed \\
I lay right down next to you \\
Held your head against my chest

And a guy with any kind of courage \\
Would maybe stop to think the matter through \\
Maybe hold you still and raise the question \\
Instead of blindly holding onto you

But we crank up the heat \\
And you giggle and moan \\
Spend all night in the company of ghosts \\
Always wake up alone

## In The Hidden Places [^hiddenjohn] ## {#hidden}

Autumn came around like a drifter to an on-ramp \\
There were wet leaves floating in gutters full of rain \\
Took to walking barefoot around town \\
Melodies from grade school kicking in my brain

Saw you on the crosstown bus today \\
You were reading a magazine \\
I turned my face away \\
And I shut my eyes tight \\
Dreamed about the flowers that hide from the light [^nightbloom] \\
On dark hillsides in the hidden places

The brakes howled and the bus pulled up near my house \\
And I got off at the corner \\
Pulled my sleeves down over my hands, over my hands \\
And I wished I was someone else \\
And I wished it was warmer

And when I got home I thought about you \\
Like a desperate policeman searching for clues \\
And I almost passed out just then \\
And I shut my eyes again \\
Headed for the dark hillsides \\
In the hidden places

[^hiddenjohn]:
    "This is a new song and it's about how sometimes you may find yourself in
    the city that you moved to from someplace else, wondering if all these
    people are out to get you, and you've lived there several months now, you
    have your evidence gathered in notebooks. Notebooks suggest yes, these
    people have evil on their minds. But every time you confront one of them
    about it, they look at you like you were crazy." --- Club Capitol, Perth,

## Song for Lonely Giants [^giantsjohn] [^giantsseries] ## {#giants}

No one washed behind my ears \\
High in the trees alone for years \\
Practicing my solitary scales 'til they rose like balloons [^plath] \\
Watching them go where they will go

Face in the leaves, song in my throat \\
Fall through the air, hoping to float \\
Practicing my solitary scales 'til they grow heavy \\
Too heavy to carry \\
Watching them go where they will go

    "This was, I think, the first one I wrote on the way to writing the new
    album, which was a couple of other albums first. I had a couple of ideas
    that --- I don't like to say of ideas that didn't go anywhere that they
    didn't go anywhere, but that's kind of the case --- but I had two
    competing ideas, neither of which went anywhere, and I was working on one
    of them, and it sort of got away from me. I was on the beach, and I saw
    this one song coming down the street, and I was like, 'There you are!
    Where have you been? I've been waiting months for you! Hungry!' It's
    called Song for Lonely Giants." --- Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh,
    September 20, 2006 (I presume this competing idea was the monster version
    of the album [mentioned above](#fn:lonelyalbumjohn) in various places.)

    "I had this vision of a, of a giant who... but who had no power of any
    kind, right, you know? Who was sort of a large fellow, but there was
    nobody around to see him. As happens when you allow yourself to dwell on
    senseless images across your consciousness, I got depressed about it. So I
    thought I would write a song about it so I could share that bad feeling
    with you." --- Bowery Ballroom, New York, September 30, 2006

    "This is a song about feeling like you don't fit in anywhere. It's called
    Song for Lonely Giants." --- Tipitina's, New Orleans, January 21, 2012

    "This is a song about being too big to take care of, and it's called Song
    for Lonely Giants." --- Visulite Theatre, Charlotte, January 31, 2012

    Once asked explicitly about the song, John responded with [John
    Mezey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mezey)'s poem *Being a Giant*:

    > Hard, hard \\
    > to be a giant, \\
    > especially here \\
    > where there are few \\
    > and one goes crazy. \\
    > Should he catch a glimpse \\
    > of the little people \\
    > running in the fields below, \\
    > their hats falling off, \\
    > it is all he can do \\
    > to keep from crying. \\
    > On white hot days \\
    > he wanders the hills \\
    > of yellow grass, \\
    > eating saplings \\
    > and stray calves, \\
    > ignoring the pains \\
    > in his belly. He carries \\
    > a small pocket mirror \\
    > in which he sometimes \\
    > looks at pieces \\
    > of his enormous face \\

    > flashing the commandments of the sun \\
    > to the empty hills.

## Woke Up New [^newjohn] [^newvideo]## {#new}

On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time \\
I felt free and I felt lonely and I felt scared \\
And I began to talk to myself almost immediately \\
Not being used to being the only person there \\
Mm-mm

The first time I made coffee for just myself, I made too much of it \\
But I drank it all just 'cause you hate it when I let things go to waste \\
And I wandered through the house like a little boy lost at the mall \\
And an astronaut could've seen the hunger in my eyes from space [^space]

And I sang \\
Oh, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do? \\
What do I do without you?

On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time \\
I was cold so I put on a sweater and I turned up the heat \\
And the walls began to close in and I felt so sad and frightened \\
I practically ran from the living room out into the street

And the wind began to blow and all the trees began to bend \\
And the world in its cold way started coming alive \\
And I stood there like a businessman waiting for a train \\
And I got ready for the future to arrive

And I sang \\
Oh, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do? \\
What do I do without you?

    "A lot of the songs that I write are about situations that you're not
    actually likely to literally find yourself in, you know. One hopes you can
    find a figurative use for them, you know. But the whole skeleton costume
    story \[from Oceanographer's Choice\], for example, if that happens to
    you, then you have better things to do with your money than buy records
    and listen to music, right: therapy, jail, you know. But this song is
    about something that --- I don't know even what I mean by this. Something
    that I hope everyone has had the pleasure of experiencing: that moment of
    profound desperation when you think, 'The precious relationship I had that
    made me feel whole is gone, and I won't ever get it back.' And this is a
    song for that moment." --- Attucks Theatre, Norfolk, Virginia, March 20,
    2009

    "As it turns out this song is like a therapeutic touchstone for me,
    because I have been married for a long time now. So my memories of the
    feeling that this song is about grow more distant by the day. But that
    doesn't --- I think there's an error that people make that when a feeling
    becomes distant to them, it loses its reality, but the whole thing about,
    you know, when you wake up the morning after a breakup, that is like one
    of the rawest, greatest gifts that you're ever gonna receive. Just the
    most horrible feeling, it's so dark and awful, right, who, I mean, it's
    like, it's the one thing that everybody can go, 'Well no, I may not be a
    suicidal person but I know what it's like to wanna die,' right, because
    you wake and you have that blissed-out moment between waking up, and
    remembering what went down yesterday. And it is the greatest, most
    horrifying moment, and may I never grow so old that I don't remember that
    brief, druggy, it's like, 'Oh hey, it's June in California, cool... I am
    alone in the universe, and no one will ever understand my pain, and it's
    just going to go on forever and ever and I will never recover, and I will
    remember this day as the beginning of the endless end', and so. This is an
    emo song, it's called Woke Up New." --- McCabe's Guitar Shop, Santa

    "Three of the songs on Get Lonely were written in a Holiday Inn Express
    when we had two days off in between tour dates, Peter and I. And we often
    share a room on tour with two beds in a Holiday Inn Express. And we were
    outside of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. There's not a lot --- there may be
    much *in* Wilkes-Barre, but once you get outside Wilkes-Barre... there's a
    big old mall. And it's huge. I mean, I've been to the Mall of America,
    it's not that big. But it's big, right. And I went --- I grew up in
    Southern California; I go to a mall, I kind of feel like I'm in the
    cradle. Peter grew up there too, but he always kind of hated that about
    it. So he went to the mall and he came back looking like he'd seen a
    ghost, he was so unhappy to have been to the mall. And it was the only
    thing nearby. There was nothing to do with our two days but go to the
    mall, or not. And he went, and he came back, and he was just so dour and
    unhappy about the mall, you know, but I had been on my own time and I was
    like, I mean, you know, they have a pretzel store there! And we were
    discussing our different takes on it, and he was like, 'Nah, it's like,
    you know, you know, it's like somebody saw the beautiful Pennsylvania
    countryside and said, I know, let's build a shopping mall you can see
    from space!' Well, later that day I'm sitting out in the hallway while
    he's getting some sleep and I'm messing around with my guitar and ended up
    using a bit of that line in this song about a person who wakes up and

## If You See Light [^lightjohn] [^lightdemo] [^morgenstern] [^lightseries] ## {#light}

When the villagers come to my door \\
I will hide underneath the table in the dining room \\
Knees drawn up to my chest

When the villagers come to my door \\
I will breathe shallow breaths from high up in my stomach \\
Ah hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah

Waiting for the front door to splinter \\
Waiting all winter

When the villagers come to my door \\
I'll be all tucked away with my face to the floor \\
And my eyes closed

And no one knows how to keep secrets 'round here \\
They tell everyone everything soon as they know \\
And then where is there left for poor sinners to go?

Waiting for the front door to splinter \\
Waiting all winter

    DBS: You've said that *Get Lonely* started as an album of songs about
    monsters. How so? What was the idea there? What was the impetus?

    JD: I don't know what the impetus was other than that I have this real
    love of monsters. A few of the songs from that beginning survive --- "If
    You See Light," which is a riff on the Frankenstein monster hiding in a
    house while the villagers bombard the doors, and "New Monster Avenue,"
    which is sort of the tranquil suburban version of the same thing, only all
    the action's internalized. --- interview with Sam Costello, Dark, but

## In Corolla [^corollajohn] [^corolla] ## {#corolla}

The day I turned my back on all you people \\
I felt an itching in my thumbs \\
Salt air like a broadcast from the distant dark beyond \\
When my transformation comes

I went down to the warm warm water \\
Saw a pelican fly past \\
Waved once at the highway and then left all that behind me \\
I went wading through the grass

And no one was gonna come and get me \\
There wasn't anybody gonna know \\
Even though I leave a trail of burnt things in my wake \\
Every single place I go

And it was cool and it was quiet \\
In the humid marsh down there \\
I let my head sink down beneath the brackish water \\
Felt it gumming up my hair

The sun was sinking into the Atlantic \\
The last time that I turned my back on you \\
I tried to summon up a little prayer as I went under \\
It was the best that I could do

And I said, let them all fare better than your servant \\
The reeds all pricking at my skin \\
Here's hoping they have better luck than I had down here with you \\
All that water rushing in

## Naming Day [^namingseries] [^namingday] ## {#naming}

I am hiding in the house \\
Someone's coming through the gate \\
When the doorbell sounds like an air raid siren \\
I am lying in wait

People used to come around \\
They fish-eyed and they rubbernecked \\
Anyone who'd come to visit now \\
Is automatically a suspect

I creep up to the window \\
Me and my buzzing brain \\
And we watch two Jehovah's witnesses [^witnesses] \\
Retreating down the lane

I'm not coming out yet \\
It's too cold \\
Leave me alone 'til I learn \\
How to spin straw into gold [^rumpelstiltskin]

I put on night vision goggles \\
Work my way along the wall into the kitchen \\
As soon as the first snow fell this year \\
My fingers started itching

And I locked up the doors \\
And I sealed up all the windows \\
And friends came by sometime for a while \\
I never let 'em in though

And then they stopped, then they stopped at last \\
And now it's just us three \\
These walls and the Church of Jesus Christ  \\
Of the Latter-day Saints and me [^mormon]

And I'm not coming out yet \\
It's too cold \\
Leave me alone 'til I learn \\
How to spin straw into gold

[^namingseries]:
    Naming Day is part of the [informal series of outtakes and
    extras](series.html#outtakes).

[^namingday]:
    I'm not exactly sure what's being referred to here, but given the context,
    I suspect some combination of two things: the day in which
    Rumpelstiltskin's name is discovered in the famous folktale ([see
    below](#fn:rumpelstiltskin)), and one of several possible Mormon
    ceremonies. The first of these is the straightforward [naming of
    children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_and_blessing_of_children)
    in the Mormon faith similar to most Christian practices, where a
    newly-born child is named and blessed by clergy of the church. The second
    is the [endowment
    ordinance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_(Mormonism)), where
    Mormons selected and recommended by their temple receive a new name and
    are initiated into some of the secrets and rituals of the church in
    preparation for the afterlife.

    How these fit together are currently unclear to me --- if you have an
    idea, please [reach out](../about.html#contact)!

[^witnesses]:
    [Jehovah's Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses)
    are a Christian denomination notable for a variety of doctrinal and
    practice differences, but famous (and noted here) for their door-to-door
    preaching. Their common beliefs include rejecting medical blood products,
    most major Christian holidays (including Christmas and Easter), the
    existence of hell, and the immortality of all souls.

[^rumpelstiltskin]:
    An allusion to the fairy tale of
    [Rumpelstiltskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumpelstiltskin), where a
    lying miller claims to the king that his daughter can spin straw into
    gold. Hearing this, the king locks the girl in a tower under threat that
    he will murder her if she cannot do as her father claimed. Desperate and
    terrified, she is relieved when an imp calling itself Rumpelstiltskin
    comes and offers to perform the task in exchange for an item of her
    jewelry. This goes on for several days with increasing volumes of straw,
    until on the third day Rumpelstiltskin demands her firstborn child. She is
    compelled to promise this, and when she gives birth (now being queen), he
    will only allow her out of the bargain if she can guess his name. She is
    again fearful, but before running out of time, comes across his home and
    hears him boasting to himself and stating his name. This allows her to
    guess correctly, upon which he storms out in a rage.

    The story and its many variations are categorized under the standard
    [Aarne--Thompson--Uther
    system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aarne%E2%80%93Thompson_classification_systems)
    as type ATU 500, The Name of the Supernatural Helper.

    I suspect that the song's title, Naming Day, refers to the final day in
    which Rumpelstiltskin's name is stated, resulting in his exit (or demise,
    depending on which version you read).

[^mormon]:

    whose practitioners are colloquially known as Mormons, is an American
    form of Christianity dating to only the 19th century. Similar to the
    [Jehovah's Witnesses mentioned earlier](#fn:witnesses), they are known for
    active preaching outreach, typically through missionaries. There's lots to
    potentially say about the church, but relative to this song, I'm unclear
    what the connection is, except for some possible [naming
    ceremonies](#fn:namingday) mentioned above. If you have any more clarity,

You went away to Stockholm [^stockholm] for a week \\

See the serpents rising from the clay

You were headed down to Salzburg [^salzburg] for the night \\

## Keeping House [^keepingseries] ## {#keeping}

*"Two, three, four."*

You clean out your junk drawer \\
You mop up some blood, while the \\
First of some new creatures \\
Rises from the mud

Cursing the moment \\
That saw him draw breath \\
The ghost on your doorstep is starving \\
To death

You spray down the windows \\
You wipe them all clean, and you \\
Douse your old clothing \\
With fresh gasoline

And the ghost on your doorstep \\
Is soaked wet with rain \\
And he clutches his stomach \\
And howls at the pain

And you can stay busy all day \\
He's never going away

So let all the lights blaze \\
Keep your heart light \\
Play really loud music \\
All hours of the night

And when you set the table \\
Set it for two \\
The ghost on your doorstep has to eat \\
Same as you \\
Same as you
