[^champjohn]:
    When announcing the upcoming album (along with a prerelease link to The
    Legend of Chavo Guerrero), John said:

    > The wrestling songs, several of which, surprise surprise, are really
    > more about death and difficult-to-navigate interior spaces than
    > wrestling 000 those will all be let out of their cages on April 7th in
    > North America... The album's called Beat the Champ, and features cover
    > art by [Leela Corman](http://www.leelacorman.com/); the vinyl will be
    > two LPs at 45 rpm with lyrics printed on the gatefold. Why lyrics now,
    > after a whole career of refusing to print lyrics? I don't know.
    > Instinct. I am especially proud of these ones. They are rather more
    > emotional than you might guess at first blush.
    >
    > There's more about the album over here, on Merge's site... All copies of
    > the deluxe LP are gold and green vinyl until we run out --- gold for the
    > championship belt, green for the payout LA wrestlers got when they took
    > home the Beat the Champ title. All that glory. All that shine. Nameless
    > bodies in unremembered rooms. Some people might be thinking to
    > themselves, JD, wrestling, I don't know, I've never really been into
    > wrestling, but did I steer you wrong with the Bible album, even though
    > you may not have been super-into the Bible? Fear not. In a world of
    > false promises and hollow gimmicks, please rest assured that the old
    > maxim still holds true, whether scrawled on the back of a claim check or
    > carved into a bench in an abandoned locker room: you can't trust much,
    > but you can trust the Mountain Goats.

    Given their related themes, there is likely some relationship between this
    album and [Undercard](undercard.html), recorded as the Extra Lens. Thanks
    to Anjalene Whittier for pointing this out!

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

__THIS RIGHT HERE IS AN ALBUM ABOUT PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING,__

which I used to watch twice a week on the UHF channels on a black and white TV
in a place on Piedmont Avenue that we rented from a dude named Arnold Pan.

My stepfather's father had been a wrestling promoter in Indiana in the '40s
and '50s. It's always a challenge for me to state simply what things were like
between my stepfather and me, because there were few sweet spots that didn't
end up getting polluted or corrupted by the dynamic of abuse, but in wrestling
we had a point of contact: in many ways, he was a child who'd never grown up,
and he liked to play the part of an antagonistic older brother at the fights.
He would take me to see the matches at the Grand Olympic, a magnificent old
building then going to seed: roller derby was also a big deal there. After the
building got sold, it hosted punk shows for a while. It's a church now. My
stepfather --- Mike --- would cheer the heels loudly and unapologetically,
sometimes to the point of getting into heated altercations with people in the
seats nearby. He would be the only person in the building applauding Eddy "the
Continental Lover" Mansfield, who was, for one brief, forgotten moment, the
most hated heel in all southern California.

Wrestling became big business in the '80s; the regional territories, which had
been a relatively small-stakes game, were folded into national promotions.
Prior to this consolidation, professional wrestling was a cheap ticket for a
working family. If you went mid-week, the Wednesday night card would set you
back five bucks. There were no frills and no pyrotechnics. The only
merchandise for sale was the program, printed in one color on a single page
folded four ways. It cost one dollar.

The situation in my house was deteriorating badly and permanently during the
span of my hyper-fandom, which lasted from when I was nine until I was maybe
thirteen. My life was chaotic and frightening. I did not cheer the heels. I
feared and hated them. I wanted to see them punished. When, in the heat of
battle, the good guys would abandon the rulebook in order to fight fire with
fire, something inside me responded primally.

These were comic-book heroes who existed in physical space. I was a child. I
needed them, and, every week, they came through for me. The southern
California territory was not a major franchise, and most of the wrestlers who
inspired fanatical devotion or froth-lipped anger at the Olympic were no-names
beyond the southwest. In 1982, the southern California promotion was sold to
Vince McMahon, and that was the end of that. During my teenage years, it was
music that would save my life, but this album is for Chavo Guerrero,
Sr., master of the moonsault, on whom I pinned my hopes
when I was very young.

## Southwestern Territory ## {#southwestern}

Small screen, July evening view \\
Up and down Grand Avenue \\
Where the legends get made \\
Out with the boys' brigade \\
Part of the motorcade

Flew home from Texas last night \\
Slept on the flight \\
Work like a dog all day \\
Born to chase cars away \\
Die on the road someday

I try to remember what life was like long ago \\
But it's gone, you know \\
Climb the turnbuckle high \\
Take two falls out of three \\
Black out for local TV

Stand in that cold empty hall \\
Wait for your name to get called \\
Burn like hillsides on fire \\
In the squall of the ringside choir \\
High as a wire

Nearly drive Danny's nose back into his brain \\
All the cheap seats go insane

Keep my eyes open and try to think straight \\
No one drives on the 60 this late \\
I feel like the last person alive \\
Francisquito to Glenshaw Drive

I try to remember to write in the diary
That my son gave me \\
Climb the turnbuckle high \\
Take two falls out of three \\
Black out for local TV


## The Legend of Chavo Guerrero [^legendjohn] [^legendvideo] ## {#legend}

Born down in El Paso, where the tumbleweeds blow \\
To the middleweight champ of all of Mexico \\
Dad fought many bloody battles, and he raised four sons \\
Chavo was the oldest one

Old man Gory could pop, like a live grenade \\
Raised his boys in the way of the trade \\
HÃ©ctor and Mando, young Eddie G \\
But Chavo meant the most to me

Look high, it's my last hope  \\
Chavo Guerrero coming off the top rope

He came from Texas seeking fortune and fame \\
Rose pretty quickly to the top of the game \\
Defender of the downtrodden, king of the hill \\
Tag team champion with Al Madril

Before a black-and-white TV in the middle of the night \\
I'm lying on the floor, I'm bathed in blue light \\
The telecast's in Spanish, I can understand some \\
And I need justice in my life, here it comes

Look high, it's my last hope \\
Chavo Guerrero coming off the top rope

Red Shoes Dugan, holding his arm high all out of breath \\
I hated all of Chavo's enemies, I would pray nightly for their deaths \\
Descending like fire on the people who deserved it most \\
Almost completely unknown outside of Texas and on the West Coast

He was my hero back when I was a kid \\
You let me down but Chavo never once did \\
You called him names to try to get beneath my skin \\
Now your ashes are scattered on the wind

I heard his son got famous and he went nationwide \\
Coast to coast, with his dad by his side \\
I don't know if that's true, but I've been told \\
It's real sweet to grow old

Look high, it's my last hope \\
Chavo Guerrero coming off the top rope

## Foreign Object [^foreignobject] ## {#foreign}

Whipped like a dog, down on the cards \\
Square in the spotlight sweating real hard \\
All soaked in blood like a newborn babe \\
Sharp thing hidden in my hand shaped like an astrolabe

Gonna stick you in the eye with a foreign object \\
Gonna poke you in the eye with a foreign object

March through the red mist, never get my vision clear \\
Learn to love this kind of atmosphere \\
Strike funny poses, keep my weapon hand low \\
Whip my head around a little, get blood on the front row

I'm gonna jab you in the eye with a foreign object \\
I personally will stab you in the eye with a foreign object \\
Foreign object, foreign object, foreign object

Sink my teeth into your scalp, take a nice big bite \\
Save nothing for the cameras, play the angles all night \\
One of these days my legs will both snap like twigs \\
If you can't beat 'em make 'em bleed like pigs

I'm gonna jab you in the eye with a foreign object \\
I'm gonna stab you in the eye with a foreign object

Ba, ba da da, ba ba ba da, foreign object \\
Ba, ba da da, ba ba ba da, foreign object \\
Ba, ba da da, ba ba ba da, foreign object

[^foreignobject]:
  A [foreign
  object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#foreign_object)
  is an object inserted into a professional wrestling match, typically
  contravening the official rules of the game. Various [types and
  methods](https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Foreign_object) have been used
  --- often by [Eddie Guerrero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Guerrero),
  Chavo Sr.'s brother, in line with his "I lie! I cheat! I steal!" catchphrase
  anm persona.

## Animal Mask ## {#animal}

*"One, two. Two, three, and."*

Eighteen-man steel cage free-for-all \\
Through the noise I hear you call for help \\
You can't protect yourself

Frog mask and yellow cape \\
So desperate to escape \\
I came to you, hands wrapped in adhesive tape

That was when we were young and green \\
In the dawning hours of our team \\
Some things you will remember \\
Some things stay sweet forever

Seen you backstage once or twice \\
Animal gimmick pops real nice \\
Elbow sweep and tiger dance \\
Little extra fighter's chance

Hold on, I cried, I'll be right there \\
Pull your mask down through your hair \\
They won't see you \\
Not until you want them to

That was when we were green and young \\
Battle cry rising from your tongue \\
Some things you will remember \\
Some things stay sweet forever

## Choked Out ## {#choked}

Diamonds in the firmament \\
All reserves completely spent \\
Someone set up the oxygen tent \\
Everybody here's real proud to present \\
Choked out

Two hundred dollar take-all purse \\
Half-nelson to suplex reverse \\
Worried look on the face of the ringside nurse \\
At one, for once, with the universe \\
Choked out

Choked out, choked out, choked out

I stretch and strain with all my might \\
Drift off into the velvety arms of the night \\
Kick and claw and scratch and bite \\
Fire up the grill, everybody eats tonight \\
Choked out

No brakes down \\
An endless dark incline \\
Most of the boys \\
Won't ever cross this line \\
If they all want to die dead broke that's fine, that's fine \\
Everybody's got their limits \\
Nobody's found mine

Crowd screaming like hounds in the heat of the chase \\
All the colors of the rainbow flood my face \\
I lift right off into space \\
I can see the future, it's a real dark place

Choked out, choked out, choked out \\
Choked out, choked out, choked out

## Heel Turn 2 ## {#heel}

Get stomped like a snake \\
Lie down in the dirt \\
Cling to my convictions \\
Even when I get hurt \\
Be an upstanding well-loved man about town \\
In your child's mind that's how it goes down

But I tried \\
The losing side \\
I don't want to die in here \\
I don't want to die in here

Drift down into the new dark light \\
Without any reservations \\
You found my breaking point \\
Congratulations \\
Spend too much of my life now trying to play fair \\
Throw my better self overboard, shoot at him when he comes up for air

Come unhinged \\
Get revenge \\
I don't want to die in here \\
I don't want to die in here

Stay good under pressure \\
For years and years and years and years \\
President of the fan club up there \\
Choking on his tears

Let all the trash rain down \\
From way up in the rafters \\
I'm walking out of here in one piece \\
Don't care what comes after

Drive the wedge \\
Torch the bridge \\
I don't want to die in here \\
I don't want to die in here

## Fire Editorial ## {#editorial}

Two blinded in Detroit \\
Something must be done \\
Jaws dropping at ringside \\
In the blood tide \\
When the fireball hits

Down Indiana way \\
Make 'em check their guns \\
Real tears when it's over \\
Smell the sulfur \\
When the dark vault splits

Lord of the hidden pocket knife \\
Tawdry dreams all come to life \\
Save yourselves \\
Save this town, save everything not nailed down

War in Ontario \\
Dead before the bell \\
Crushed hopes of the young breed \\
All the best bleed \\
All the proud boys break

Who will stand before the flood? \\
Who will mop up all the blood? \\
Who alone? \\
Skin, bone, steel, stone \\
Swim or drown \\
Save this town, save everything not nailed down

## Stabbed to Death Outside San Juan ## {#stabbed}

The winter's wet, and the summer's hot \\
Take a match in Puerto Rico, why not \\
Power and adrenaline flowing like amber \\
From the recesses of the earth, put on your waders \\
And twitch when the water runs high sometimes \\
Twitch when the tide ebbs low

See the sights, maybe go downtown \\
Sometimes you get some heat, sometimes it follows you around \\
When the blade hits the bone, everybody hears it sing \\
Shower room full of people, no one hears a goddamned thing \\
And twitch when the current runs wild sometimes \\
Twitch when the contact howls

All that racket out there in the arena \\
I'm on a stretcher, here come the cleaners \\
And the sky goes dark and there I am \\
Climbing down the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram \\
I drop from the top of my tall steel cage \\
Drop to the concrete floor

## Werewolf Gimmick ## {#werewolf}

I was not there for rehearsal, I don't need it any more \\
When I show up just in time to pop you can clear the goddamn floor \\
Empty out the locker room, let me find my space \\
Let him who thinks he knows no fear look well upon my face \\
Nameless bodies in unremembered rooms \\
Know how a man becomes a beast when the wolfbane blooms

Sail past all the grasping hands, floodlights white and hot \\
Bring my vision into focus, find out what I've got \\
Some sniveling local babyface with an angle he can't sell \\
Full werewolf off the buckle like an angel straight from hell \\
Nameless bodies in unremembered rooms \\
Run howling through the carnage when the wolfbane blooms

Half the city sound asleep and safe inside their beds \\
Get lost inside my thoughts and nearly tear his face to shreds \\
Blood pooling on the canvas as the atmosphere gets hushed \\
Bring your heroes to the wolf den, watch them all get crushed \\
Get told to maybe dial it back backstage later on \\
Everyone still in this building right now: dead before the dawn \\
Nameless bodies in unremembered rooms \\
The pure at heart go putrid when the wolfbane blooms

## Luna ## {#luna}

All gone, all gone \\
Watching it go up out front on the lawn \\
Stay on my feet somehow \\
I'm strong now \\
Stuck there, no air

Head high, head high \\
Tongues of fire that reach up for the sky \\
Rise through the smoke \\
The dust of the grave \\
I will be saved

Pause in mid-stride \\
Pause in mid-stride \\
And ride, and ride, and ride, and ride

Burn hard, burn hard \\
Smoldering pieces landing in the yard \\
Trace names in ash \\
Big names, old friends  \\
And dead ends

Those last few frames \\
Go down so fast \\
Rise through the flames and end again in flames at last

Stay free, stay free \\
Invisible armies march by night for me \\
Stay on my guard \\
Burn hard \\
Rage on \\
All gone

Pause in mid-stride \\
Pause in mid-stride \\
And ride, and ride, and ride, and ride

## Unmasked! ## {#unmasked}

Rain beats down, down on the outer walls \\
Down on the skylight, where the streetlights \\
Shine like unquenchable coals \\
And I'm up high, trying to say goodbye \\
The only way I know how \\
Crude and graceless \\
Peeking through the eyeholes \\
Seeing the real you

And just after midnight \\
When it feels like it's getting late \\
I will reveal you \\
I will reveal you

Crowd's half-gone, just a few hangers-on \\
Come to see me finally tear through the stitching at last \\
You don't care, you look almost relieved down there \\
Like you're free, like you can breathe now \\
Like they've sawn off your cast \\
One more sleeper to see through

And by way of honoring \\
The things we once both held dear \\
I will reveal you \\
I will reveal you

Cast of thousands \\
But we were the real two \\
When I'm alone \\
Before a mirror late at night \\
I will reveal you \\
I will reveal you

## The Ballad of Bull Ramos ## {#ballad}

Drive a great big truck \\
When I'm old, when I'm old \\
Haul the wrecks down to the wreck yard \\
Help the boys unload \\
Keep my hair nice and long \\
Because I can, because I can \\
Any of my old friends who have no place to turn to \\
They know to call me any time they come through

Never die, never die \\
Stand with a bullwhip in my hand \\
And rise, rise \\
In the desert sand

Work days, work nights \\
Finally get laid up \\
By a piece of broken glass \\
On the floor of the shop \\
And the doctor recognizes me \\
As the operating theater goes dim \\
Aren't you that old wrestler with the bullwhip? \\
Yes sir, that's me, I'm him

Get around fine on one leg \\
Lose a kidney, then go blind \\
Sit on my porch in Houston \\
Let the good times dance across my mind

Never die, never die \\
Stand with a bullwhip in my hand \\
And rise, rise \\
Surrounded by friends

## Hair Match ## {#hair}

You'll be maybe lunging for the bad guy's hip \\
No one anticipates the sunset flip \\
The referee and your opponent will hold you there \\
And we're gonna bring in a folding chair

We'll stipulate that there will be no cameras filming \\
But of course there will be several in the building \\
And if by chance somebody hits record \\
And stands real still somewhere back behind the soundboard

Cheap electric razor from the Thrifty down the street \\
Two guys down around your ankles so you'll stay put in your seat \\
Buzzing razor held aloft and just about to strike \\
I loved you before I even ever knew what love was like

Some people leave before it's over, but most of them stay \\
Some hide behind their programs, some turn away \\
Out in the parking lot you look up at the stars \\
And all the cheap cars
