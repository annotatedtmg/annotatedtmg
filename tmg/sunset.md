[^sunsetjohn]:
    John has described in many places that this album is about his childhood,
    in which he and his family were abused by his stepfather. The album was
    written after his stepfather's death caused John to write about his
    family. Some of the songs also reference his use of heroin, cocaine, and
    other drugs in Claremont, and later his use of methamphetamine in
    Portland, which was covered more extensively in [We Shall All Be
    Healed](wsabh.html). These two albums are the only markedly
    autobiographical albums in the Mountain Goats corpus.

    John describes this excellently at the Bowery Ballroom, New York, March
    28, 2011 and on WTF with Marc Maron #366, March 4, 2013, but also at the
    KEXP session, May 21, 2004; Black Cat, Washington, DC, October 11, 2004;
    KEXP session, June 16, 2005; Duke Coffeehouse, Durham, November 5, 2005;
    City Arts and Lectures, Herbst Theatre, San Francisco, February 24, 2009;
    Calvin College interview, October 22, 2012.

    The album was temporarily titled "Near the Original Pantry" prior to John
    deciding on The Sunset Tree. The [Original
    Pantry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Pantry_Cafe) is a historic
    cafÃ© and restaurant in the South Park district of downtown Los Angeles,
    located on South Figueroa Street. The term referred to the location of the
    now-gone [Grand Olympic
    Auditorium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Olympic_Auditorium), where
    he would attend wrestling matches with his stepfather, as well as being
    near the location of several Mountain Goats songs (such [You or Your
    Memory](#memory) and [Design Your Own Container
    Garden](america.html#container)). WTF with Marc Maron #366, March 4, 2013.

[^sunsetseries]:
    The Sunset Tree is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^tyrolean]:
    The title of the Sunset Tree takes its name from the chorus and opening
    lines of the Tyrolese Evening Hymn, also known as Come to the Sunset Tree,
    published in the early 19th century by [Felicia
    Hemans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicia_Hemans). In the song, workers
    are encouraged to rest at the sunset tree after a long day of labor:

    > Come, come, come \\
    > Come to the sunset tree \\
    > The day is past and gone \\
    > The woodman's axe lies free \\
    > and the reaper's work is done \\
    > The twilight star to Heaven \\
    > And the summer dew to flowers \\
    > And rest to us is given \\
    > By the cool soft evening hours
    >
    > Come, come, come \\
    > Come to the sunset tree \\
    > The day is past and gone \\
    > The woodman's axe lies free \\
    > and the reaper's work is done
    >
    > Sweet is the hour of rest \\
    > Pleasant the wood's low sign \\
    > And the gleaming of the west \\
    > And the turf whereon we lie \\
    > When the burden and the heat \\
    > Of labor's task are o'er \\
    > And kindly voices greet \\
    > The tired one at his door
    >
    > Come, come, come \\
    > Come to the sunset tree \\
    > The day is past and gone \\
    > The woodman's axe lies free \\
    > and the reaper's work is done
    >
    > Yes, tuneful is the sound \\
    > That dwells in whispering boughs \\
    > Welcome the freshness round \\
    > And the gale that fans our brows \\
    > But rest more sweet and still \\
    > Than ever night-fall gave \\
    > Our longing hearts shall fill \\
    > In the world beyond the grave
    >
    > Come, come, come \\
    > Come to the sunset tree \\
    > The day is past and gone \\
    > The woodman's axe lies free \\
    > and the reaper's work is done
    >
    > There shall no tempest blow \\
    > No scorching noontide beat \\
    > There shall be no more snow \\
    > No weary wandering feet \\
    > So we lift our trusting eyes \\
    > From the hills our fathers trod \\
    > To the quiet of the skies \\
    > To the Sabbath of our God
    >
    > Come, come, come \\
    > Come to the sunset tree \\
    > The day is past and gone \\
    > The woodman's axe lies free \\
    > and the reaper's work is done

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

"The howling of the wind in the window... Uncle Balt yelling... Several sounds
that bombs make... The eerie echoes you sometimes get in caves... They get
replayed." William H. Gass [^gass]

*Made possible by my stepfather, Mike Noonan (1940 -- 2004): \\
may the peace which eluded you in life be yours now*

Dedicated to any young men and women anywhere who live with people who abuse
them, with the following good news: \\
*you are going to make it out of there alive*

*you will live to tell your story*

*never lose hope*

[^gass]:
    These lines are taken from William H. Gass' major novel [The
    Tunnel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tunnel_(novel)), which presents
    itself as the work of Kohler, a professor of history, who, attempting to
    write a work about Nazi Germany, instead describes his own brutal life
    while digging a tunnel out of his basement. They stand alone in their own
    paragraph at the end of a chapter, following a description of one of
    Kohler's lovers being murdered and sexually exploited by the Nazis (p.
    116). Apart from the original reading "Several sounds that bombs made",
    the lines are unchanged.

    [William H. Gass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Gass) himself
    is an American author, former philosophy professor, and now humanities
    professor emeritus from Washington University.

## You or Your Memory [^memoryjohn] [^memoryseries] [^memorydemo] ## {#memory}

I checked into a bargain-priced room on La Cienega [^lacienega] \\
Gazed out through the curtains at the parking lot \\
Walked down to the cornerstore just before nightfall in my bare feet \\
Black tarry asphalt, soft and hot \\
And when I came back, I spread out my supplies \\
On the counter by the sink, looked myself right in the eyes

St. Joseph's baby aspirin [^stjoseph] \\
Bartles & Jaymes [^bartles] \\
And you \\
Or your memory

I ducked behind the drapes when I saw the moon begin to rise \\
Gathered in my loose ends, switched off the light \\
And down there in the dark I could see the real truth about me \\
As clear as day, Lord, if I make it through tonight \\
And I will mend my ways \\
And walk the straight path 'til the end of my days

St. Joseph's baby aspirin \\
Bartles & Jaymes \\
And you \\
Or your memory

[^memoryjohn]:
    "This is a song about how... someday you might find yourself in a hotel
    --- well, hotel is a generous term --- you might find yourself in a motor
    lodge, The Royal Hawaiian motor lodge on Crenshaw. There's a Polaroid
    picture of a naked lady in the window of the Royal Hawaiian, and it says,
    'Sexy Movie, $5'. That's how you know it's a class act, the Royal
    Hawaiian. You may find yourself there someday, plotting what you might do
    there. I don't recommend what you had in mind. Better days are coming."
    --- Club Europa, Brooklyn, September 29, 2006. See also Andy Warhol
    Museum, Pittsburgh, July 20, 2006; St George's, Bristol, October 7, 2013.

    "It's a song that takes place in a hotel, a hotel whose secret name,
    secret because none of y'all were there and I were, was --- probably going
    back someday --- the Royal Hawaiian, the Royal Hawaiian hotel. Motel. I
    really think to call it a hotel would be putting on airs. The Royal
    Hawaiian hotel, it was a mile and a half from the AIDS hospice where I was
    working, from which I got fired after I got arrested. You can't be working
    in the AIDS hospital jobs if you're gonna spend time in jail. I was an
    honest man, I came in, I said, 'Hey, I just think I should let you guys
    know, I spent the weekend in jail.' That's what 21-year-olds are like. I
    said, hey, they'll be cool, they're probably all right. But my employer
    was actually the Roman Catholic Church, they weren't cool with that. They
    said, 'Cool, come back if --- what are you going to plea?' I said, 'No
    contest.' 'All right, well, we'll see you again sometime.'" --- The EARL,
    Atlanta, November 3, 2006.

    "This is a song about how I was fourteen years old and I had gotten to
    high school and I was kind of terrified to be in high school because I was
    a scrawny little fellow, unlike the gigantic hulking mass you see before
    you today, and I was pretty terrified, 'cause in junior high it was bad,
    there were people coming to kick my ass, but there weren't so many of
    them, but at the high school in my town, there's 900 people there, and I
    knew there was a fair number just waiting on me to get there to kick my
    ass, right. And I was tiny, I was a little fellow, and I got there and the
    first month or two was pretty bad, first semester was pretty bad, and then
    I met a girl named Marcie Dean. Marcie Dean was the chief of the stage
    makeup crew. Marcie Dean and I began to date, shortly thereafter, we began
    to have sex three times a day. \<cheers\> You're fucking right. Because
    then, when I'd be getting my ass kicked, I'd look up at the guy kicking my
    ass, and go, 'You can kick my ass all day. It'll still be two years before
    you're where I'm at, beyotch', right. This is the only song I ever wrote
    for Marcie Dean, whom I will probably never see again." --- 40 Watt Club,

[^terraplane]:
    The [Hudson Motor Car
    Company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Motor_Car_Company) was a
    major Detroit-based automobile company from 1909 through the 1950s, when
    it formed American Motors in a merger with another firm. Most 1930s
    Hudsons had a straight-six engine, which itself is [the name of another
    Mountain Goats song](jam.html#six). The primary manufacturing line in 1936
    was the [Terraplane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraplane), a powerful
    now-classic car.

    John explains that as a fourteen-year-old, he was having sex not in the
    back of a Hudson but in the back of a Honda Civic. Bowery Ballroom, New
    York, September 20, 2006; Gargoyle, St. Louis, October 23, 2006.

[^sodiumvapor]:
    I'm not entirely sure what the sodium flares refer to here. My best guess
    is that it refers to a [sodium-vapor
    lamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-vapor_lamp), commonly used in
    streetlamps. Sodium flare also refers to the light seen when heating
    silica during glasswork. Other hypotheses include that this means to refer
    to a signal lamp or an emergency flare. If you have a better idea, [I'd
    love to know about it](../about.html#contact).


## This Year [^thisyearjohn] [^thisyeardemo] [^thisyearmusicvideo] [^thisyearseries] ## {#thisyear}

I broke free on a Saturday morning \\
I put the pedal to the floor \\
Headed north on Mills Avenue [^mills] \\
And listened to the engine roar

My broken house behind me and good things ahead \\
A girl named Kathy wants a little of my time \\
Six cylinders underneath the hood crashing and kicking \\
Ah-ha, listen to the engine whine

I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me \\
I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me

I played video games [^videogame] in a drunken haze \\
I was seventeen years young \\
Hurt my knuckles punching the machines \\
The taste of Scotch [^scotchnames] rich on my tongue

Then Kathy showed up and we hung out \\
Trading swigs from the bottle all bitter and clean \\
Locking eyes, holding hands \\
Twin high-maintenance machines

I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me \\
I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me

I drove home in the California dusk \\
I could feel the alcohol inside of me hum \\
Pictured the look on my stepfather's face \\
Ready for the bad things to come

I downshifted as I pulled into the driveway \\
The motor screaming out, stuck in second gear \\
The scene ends badly as you might imagine \\
In a cavalcade of anger and fear

There will be feasting and dancing in Jerusalem next year [^seder] \\
I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me \\
I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me [^almostkilledme]

    "This is a song about when you are having a year that you need to see it
    through to the end of." --- Wexner Center, Columbus, April 11, 2011

    "This is a song about how sometimes you are living in a house, and you're
    in high school, and your stepfather is abusing your mother and you, and it
    really sucks --- you have to take a lot of drugs to deal with that, right
    --- well, you don't have to, I should say, but you probably do. And when
    you do, they make you feel marginally better but the main thing that makes
    you feel better is the company of other people who are as damaged as you
    are or will shortly become as damaged as you are, and you can sense it,
    because there is an internal sensor if you bear some damage, there is this
    sensor that says, 'That person is either damaged or is getting there, and
    I think I will hang out with her until things get a little brighter'. I
    play this for a lovely person who wore a cape to school, it's called This
    Year." --- Bowery Ballroom, March 30, 2011

    Given the cape context, I think it's reasonable to speculate that this may
    be about the same person that You Were Cool is about.

    This Year was one of few songs that didn't get finished at first, was
    shelved, and was unexpectedly resurrected, unlike John's typical pattern,
    in which songs are completed in one session or thrown out.

[^thisyearmusicvideo]:
    This Year is one of very few Mountain Goats songs to have a [music
    video](http://vimeo.com/7907281). Opening with the first few seconds of

    This Year is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible) and [informal series of

[^mills]:
    Mills Avenue is a major north-south road through Claremont. On the north
    end, it becomes Claremont Boulevard, which passes through the Claremont
    Colleges (bordering Pitzer, where John attended), to the south, it crosses
    the 10 Freeway and terminates at Holt Boulevard one block east of Indian
    Hill Boulevard, a nexus of many Mountain Goats songs (including
    [Palmcorder Yajna](wsabh.html#yajna), [From TG&Y](online.html#fromtgny),
    [Short Song About the 10 Freeway](peter.html#tenfreeway), and other songs
    on [We Shall All Be Healed](wsabh.html) and The Sunset Tree).

[^videogame]:
    Sometimes sung with a specific name, such as "I played Mike Tyson's
    Punch-Out!! in a drunken haze". Other games referenced include Mr. Do! and
    Aero Fighters. (Incidentally, Mr. Do is the name of the rat on the cover
    of [Beautiful Rat Sunset](brs.html).) Also occasionally sung with an
    alcohol, such as "I played video games in a Cutty Sark haze", similarly to
    [the footnote below](#fn:scotchnames). Doug Fir
    Lounge, Portland, June 20, 2005; 9:30 Club, Washington, DC, November 27,

    Festival, Fort Adams State Park, Rhode Island, July 26, 2013.

[^scotchnames]:
    Sometimes sung with other alcohols in place of Scotch, such as Allegheny
    or Cutty Sark. See also [the above footnote](#fn:videogame). Andy Warhol
    Museum, Pittsburgh, September 20, 2006; Bimbo's 365 Club, San Francisco,

[^almostkilledme]:
    Often sung with a final line or couplet, "And it almost killed me". Cat's
    Cradle, Chicago, April 8, 2011; El Rey, Los Angeles, June 23, 2011.

[^seder]:
    A reference to the phrase spoken at the conclusion of the [Passover
    Seder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_Seder), "Next year in
    Jerusalem". The saying reflects the hope that one day the Messiah will
    return to and rebuild
    [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem), an ancient and holy
    city to all Abrahamic religions. Passover itself celebrates the escape of
    the Jews from slavery in Egypt under the leadership of Moses, aided by
    God's infliction of ten plagues upon the Egyptians.

The reception's gotten fuzzy \\
The delicate balance has shifted \\
Put on your gloves and your black pumps [^topcoat] \\
Let's pretend the fog has lifted \\
Now you see me \\
Now you don't \\
Now you say you love me \\
Pretty soon you won't \\
If we get our full three score and ten [^psalm9010] \\
We won't pass this way again \\
So kiss me with your mouth open \\
Turn the tires toward the street [^b210] \\
And stay sweet

All the chickens come on home to roost \\
Plump bodies blotting out the sky \\
You know it breaks my heart in half, in half \\
When I see them trying to fly \\
'Cause you just can't do \\
Things your body wasn't meant to \\
Hike up your fishnets [^dilaudidjackie] \\
I know you \\
If we live to see the other side of this \\
I will remember your kiss \\
So do it with your mouth open \\
And take your foot off of the brake \\
For Christ's sake

    "This is a song about how when you're in love but you know it's going to
    hell, you take drugs and have sex." --- Canopy Club, Urbana, October 12,

    "This is a song about an ex-girlfriend of mine, whom I loved more than I
    had ever loved anyone at that point. I was 16, so I hadn't loved all that
    many people. You know how it is, right --- I mean, like, it gets inside of
    you, and you say, 'Oh my God, not only is this awesome', but if you're me,
    and I suspect if you're anybody who's 16, you go, 'Not only is this
    awesome, none of these other people are experiencing anything remotely
    like this. My deal is way better than the stuff I see people doing at
    school. Those people are lame, I'm sure they're enjoying themselves but
    they don't have what we have. Because what we have is special, right.' You
    get up in that frame of mind, and if you got somebody else who's just as
    driven and narcissistic as yourself, oh, boy can you dig a deep hole." ---
    Club Europe, Brooklyn, September 29, 2006; Bowery Ballroom, New York,
    October 1, 2007.

    John has described this as the successor to the story in Broom People
    where he's finding liberation in sex in a Honda Civic. "And then, do you
    remember, a couple of years later, how you discovered that once the
    interest had waned in that, there were people in town with harder drugs.
    Really good stuff. Stuff that could put you in the hospital, if you're
    lucky. This song is about those good times and great oldies." --- Bowery

## Dance Music [^dancejohn] ## {#dance}

All right, I'm on Johnson Avenue in San Luis Obispo [^obispo] \\
And I'm five years old or six maybe \\
And indications that there's something wrong with our new house \\
Trip down the wire twice daily \\
I'm in the living room watching the Watergate hearings [^watergate] \\
While my stepfather yells at my mother \\
Launches a glass across the room, straight at her head \\
And I dash upstairs to take cover \\
Lean in close to my little record player on the floor \\
So this is what the volume knob's for \\
I listen to dance music \\
Dance music

OK, so look, I'm seventeen years old [^altage] \\
And you're the last, best thing I got going [^dancejackie] \\
But then the special secret sickness starts to eat through you \\
What am I supposed to do, no way of knowing \\
So I follow you down your twisting alleyways \\
Find a few cul-de-sacs of my own \\
There's only one place this road ever ends up [^dancejackie] \\
And I don't want to die alone [^singit] \\
Let me down, let me down, let me down gently \\
When the police come to get me, I'm listening to dance music \\
Dance music

[^dancejohn]:
    "That song, like everything else on the Sunset Tree, is a true story, and
    that one's a pretty naked true story, where it's two scenes, one from
    childhood and one from my teenage years that I'm sort of drawing a
    connection between. And the second one was the night that they declined to
    arrest my girlfriend and myself. And the thing that I remembered was the
    anger of the policeman because I think he'd thought he was going to find
    something on us, but he didn't, because it was already all in our bodies.
    But we were parked in my car, and the police cruiser came up behind us,
    and we saw the lights, 'Oh, this sucks', right, and so he came up and he
    was really livid and was yelling at me about how he'd had a tip-off as to
    what we were up to, which was hard drugs with needles." --- Old Town
    School of Folk Music, Chicago, April 19, 2014. He has in other places
    emphasized the connection between the two events being music, see Apolo,
    Barcelona, October 19, 2013.

    The opening verse is clearly about child abuse. However, he's occasionally
    explicitly stated such or elaborated on his experiences. Two key
    elaborations are that these events took place in the first apartment he
    lived in after his parents divorced, and that what made these events
    especially painful is that his stepfather was a fun person that they loved
    when he wasn't being violent. See especially Letters to Santa, Chicago,
    December 12, 2011 and WTF with Marc Maron #366, March 4, 2013, but also

    John describes that the record player on the floor was a [flexi
    disc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexi_disc) player that came with a
    recording of the famous, "One small step for a man, one giant leap for
    mankind" Apollo 11 moon landing speech that he listened to when he was
    upset. Club Capitol, Perth, January 2, 2007.

    The song originally had a complex piano portion written and played by
    Franklin Bruno, but John ended up playing a pared-down version as John had
    gotten drunk to help get through the emotional intensity of recording the
    Sunset Tree and the vocal track was slurred in the original take. A great
    version of this story is told at the Bowery Ballroom, New York, October 1,
    2006.

[^obispo]:
    [San Luis
    Obispo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Obispo,_California) is a
    small coastal college town in California midway between San Francisco and
    Los Angeles, home to [California Polytechnic State
    University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Polytechnic_State_University).
    Johnson Avenue is a northwest to southeast running street which heads into
    downtown San Luis Obispo to the north and turning due south before ending
    at Orcutt Road on the other end. This area is south of the freeway from
    the university.

[^watergate]:
    The [Watergate scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal)
    was an infamous political scandal in the 1970s following the
    burglarization and wiretapping of the Democratic National Committee
    headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, DC and the Nixon
    administration's attempts to avoid culpability by covering up their
    involvement. Ultimately, the scandal led to Nixon's impeachment in 1974.
    The hearings themselves took place in 1973.

[^altage]:
    Occasionally sung with other ages, such as 28. The EARL, Atlanta, October
    18, 2004.

[^dancejackie]:
    This verse often invokes Jackie, either as, "And Jackie, you're the last
    best thing I got going", or, "There's only one place this road ever ends
    up, Jackie". Jackie (presumably from the [above banter](#fn:dancejohn),
    John's girlfriend at the time) is referenced in alternate lyrics to other

## Dinu Lipatti's Bones [^dinujohn] [^dinudemo] [^dinuseries] [^dinulipatti] ## {#dinu}

We stank of hair dye and ammonia [^perm] \\
We sealed ourselves away from view \\
You were looking at the void and seldom blinking \\
The best that I could do \\
Was to train my eyes on you

We scaled the hidden hills beneath the surface \\
Scraped our fingers bloody on the stones \\
And built a little house that we could live in \\
Out of Dinu Lipatti's bones

We kept our friends at bay all summer long \\
Treated the days as if they'd kill us if they could \\
Ringing out the hours like blood-drenched bedsheets \\
To keep wintertime at bay \\
But December showed up anyway

There was no money, it was money that you wanted \\
I went downtown, sold off most of what I owned \\
And we raised a tower to broadcast all our dark dreams \\
From Dinu Lipatti's bones [^dinudemolyrics]

    The ammonia creates a basic environment to increase the activity of an
    oxidant, usually hydrogen peroxide, which lightens the hair. Ammonia is
    also believed to increase dye penetration.

## Up the Wolves [^wolvesjohn] [^wolvesdemo] [^wolvesseries] ## {#wolves}

There's bound to be a ghost at the back of your closet \\
No matter where you live \\
There'll always be a few things, maybe several things \\
That you're gonna find really difficult to forgive

There's gonna come a day when you feel better \\
You'll rise up free and easy on that day \\
And float from branch to branch, higher than the air \\
Just when that day is coming, who can say, who can say

Our mother has been absent \\
Ever since we founded Rome \\
But there's gonna be a party when the wolf comes home [^romulus]

We're gonna commandeer the local airwaves \\
To tell the neighbors what's been going on \\
And they will shake their heads, and wag their bony fingers \\
In all the wrong directions, and by daybreak we'll be gone

I'm gonna get myself in fighting trim \\
Scope out every angle of unfair advantage \\
I'm gonna bribe the officials, I'm gonna kill all the judges \\
It's gonna take you people years to recover from all of the damage

Our mother has been absent \\
Ever since we founded Rome \\
But there's gonna be a party when the wolf comes home

    "This is a song about how sometimes you have to proclaim bad things good
    and good things bad to stand your day. That's all it's about." --- Bowery
    Ballroom, New York, September 30, 2006

    "I'm always trying to figure out what to say about this goddamn song. Part
    of me wants to say, 'Well, it's about revenge.' But as soon as I say that,
    I go, 'No, that's not quite it.' Part of me wants to say, 'Well, it's
    about the satisfaction of not needing revenge.' And then I say, 'No,
    that's some New Age stuff, you know, you're not up on that business,' But
    I think it's a song about the moment in your quest for revenge when you
    learn to embrace the futility of it. You really --- when you know that the
    thing that you want is ridiculous and pompous, and a terrible thing to
    want anyway, and the direction in which you're headed is not the direction
    you want to go, yet you're going to head that way a while longer anyway,
    because that's just the kind of person you are." --- Bowery Ballroom, New
    York, October 1, 2007. See also Showbox, Seattle, December 17, 2012.

[^romulus]:
    An allusion to [Romulus and
    Remus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_and_Remus), the twin brothers
    and mythological founders of Rome. Their grandfather, Numitor, was the
    deposed king of Alba Longa in Italy, and their mother, Rhea Silva, was
    made a Vestal Virgin to eliminate Numitor's lineage. Therefore, when she
    conceived (either by the god Mars or the divine hero Hercules), the new
    king abandoned them in the river Tiber to die. Instead, however, they are
    nursed by a wolf and fed by a woodpecker until they are found and raised
    by shepherds. When they become men, they overthrow the false king,
    reinstate Numitor, and found Rome.

## Lion's Teeth [^lionsjohn] [^lionsdemo] [^lionsseries] ## {#lions}

The king of the jungle \\
Was asleep in his car \\
When your chances fall in your lap like that \\
You gotta recognize them for what they really are

Nobody in this house \\
Wants to own up to the truth \\
I crawl in shotgun and reach into his mouth \\
Grab hold of one long, sharp tooth

And hold on \\
For dear life \\
I hold on

Well, course he wakes up \\
His paw hits the horn \\
I am gonna regret [^doregret] \\
The day that I was born

And then Mom rushes out to the driveway \\
My sister too [^theresa] \\
Everyone screaming \\
I am dreaming of you

I hold on \\
For dear life \\
I hold on

And my arms get sore \\
And my palms start to sweat \\
And the tears roll down my face \\
'Til my cheeks are hot and red and soaking wet

In come the cops \\
They blowtorch the doors \\
I start wailing \\
The lion roars

There's no good way to end this \\
Anyone can see \\
There's this great big you \\
And little old me

And we hold on \\
For dear life [^bothhands] \\
We hold on \\
We hold on

## Hast Thou Considered the Tetrapod [^tetrapodjohn] [^job] [^tetrapodseries] [^tetrapod] ## {#tetrapod}

You are sleeping off your demons \\
When I come home \\
Spittle bubbling on your lips \\
Fine white foam \\
I am young and I am good \\
It's a hot Southern California day \\
If I wake you up \\
There will be hell to pay \\
And alone in my room \\
I am the last of a lost civilization \\
And I vanish into the dark \\
And rise above my station \\
Rise above my station

But I do wake you up, and when I do \\
You blaze down the hall and you scream \\
I'm in my room with the headphones on \\
Deep in the dream chamber \\
And then I'm awake and I'm guarding my face \\
Hoping you don't break my stereo \\
Because it's the one thing that I couldn't live without \\
And so I think about that, and then I sort of black out \\
Held under these smothering waves \\
By your strong and thick-veined hand \\
But one of these days \\
I'm gonna wriggle up on dry land

[^tetrapodjohn]:
    "This is one of those songs where when I tell people what it's about they

    those songs about how if you're 13 and you live in a house where your
    stepfather beats your mother nightly --- see, I told you. Some of us from
    these houses, we laugh when we remember the things. I don't know why, if I
    figure out why I'm gonna right a self-help book about it. But in the
    meantime, this is a song about the headphones that were most important to
    me when I was 14." --- Durham Armory, Durham Be Easy Festival, August 14,

[^job]:
    This title is potentially an allusion to God's discussion of
    [Job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Job) with Satan, in which Job
    is held as a paradigm of virtue:

    "And the Lord said unto Satan, 'Hast thou considered my servant Job, that
    there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one
    that feareth God, and escheweth evil?'"

    Satan subsequently torments Job in an attempt to wrest his faith away, and
    the Book of Job uses his suffering (and ultimate reprieve) to explore the
    inaccessibility of wisdom and the nature of suffering even among good
    people.

[^tetrapod]:

    evolved from lobe-finned fishes, and contains all extant and extinct
    mammals, reptiles, birds, and amphibians, including modern members who no
    longer have four limbs but whose ancestors did (such as snakes). While
    modern tetrapods are primarily terrestrial, the most ancient tetrapods
    likely were aquatic. This superclass contains the animals who made the
    transition from oceanic life to terrestrial life.

## Song for Dennis Brown [^dennisjohn] [^dennisdemo] [^dennisseries] [^dennisbrown] ## {#dennis}

On the day that Dennis Brown's lung collapsed, spring rain was misting down on Kingston [^kingston] \\
And down at the harbor, local cops were intercepting an inbound shipment \\
And for a while there it was chaos \\
As they handcuffed and then roughed up some sailors

On the day my lung collapses \\
It's not gonna be much different

On the day that Dennis Brown's habits caught up with him, schoolchildren sang in choirs \\
And out behind the Chinese restaurants, guys were jumping into dumpsters \\
And the stench was overbearing \\
But they were past the point of caring

On the day my habits catch up with me \\
I'll be down among the jumpers

And when the birds come home in spring, [^roost] we will fill them full of buckshot \\
And jets of contaminated blood will cloud the rivers and the lakes \\
It took all the coke in town \\
To bring down Dennis Brown

On the day my lung collapses \\
We'll see just how much it takes

[^dennisjohn]:
    "Dennis Brown was a reggae singer with a gorgeous, gorgeous voice, just
    amazing, beautiful voice and beautiful feeling, who like a lot of people
    in the '80s and '90s, and a lot of people always, I guess, developed a
    bottomless thirst for cocaine, and eventually it killed him. I mean, some
    drugs, like, you know, heroin, it's easy to die, you know, and you can
    really just make a wrong turn and die. But you gotta work to kill yourself
    with cocaine, you really got to mean it and ramp yourself up and get going
    so bad that you enlarge your heart and in his case, collapse your lung.
    And so, I mean, me in high school, living in the house I lived in, really,
    really, you know, and I thought about --- it always feels very strange to
    start talking about this stuff --- I thought about killing myself every
    single day. Every single day. And it was like the main thing I thought
    about, you know, and I didn't want to hang out with anybody who didn't
    find that an interesting topic of conversation, you know. And, you know,
    and I think I got like a lot of would-be suicides do a sort of a thrill
    out of how frightened people are if you talk about that kind of stuff.
    And so, since in writing this album, I was trying to get in touch with
    that angry, frightened, 17-year-old man that I once was, you know, I
    thought about how I would have, well, I was reading about Dennis Brown,
    and I felt just like I would have felt at 17. I would have thought, 'Oh,
    what a great thing, you know, that he went so insane that nobody could
    touch him.'" --- KEXP session, June 16, 2005. See also China Clipper,

[^dennisbrown]:
    [Dennis Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Brown) was an
    influential Jamaican reggae singer in the mid to late 20th century, also
    known as the Crown Prince of Reggae. He died in 1999 after years of
    cocaine-derived respiratory issues developed into pneumonia, leading to a
    cardiac arrest. He died the next day of a pneumothorax.

[^kingston]:
    [Kingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica) is the capital
    of Jamaica and the location of Dennis Brown's death.

[^roost]:
    On the Come, Come to the Sunset Tree demo, this is sung, "And when the
    birds come home to roost, we will fill them full of buckshot". This
    phrasing more clearly echoes the old metaphor of chickens coming home to
    roost, meaning that wrongs done come back to hurt their perpetrator, a
    theme also brought up in [Dilaudid](#dilaudid). John has confirmed that
    this metaphor was intended even in the final studio version. Fulton Mall

## Love Love Love [^lovedemo] [^loveseries] ## {#love}

King Saul fell on his sword when it all went wrong [^saul] \\
And Joseph's brother sold him down the river for a song [^joseph] \\
And Sonny Liston rubbed some Tiger Balm into his glove [^liston] \\
Some things you do for money, and some you do for love, love, love

Raskolnikov felt sick, but he couldn't say why [^raskolnikov] \\
When he saw his face reflected in his victim's twinkling eye \\
Some things you'll do for money, and some you'll do for fun \\
But the things you do for love are gonna come back to you one by one [^trembling]

Love, love is gonna lead you by the hand \\
Into a white and soundless place [^fine] \\
Now we see things as in a mirror dimly \\
Then we shall see each other face to face [^1corinthians1312]

And way out in Seattle, young Kurt Cobain \\
Snuck out to the greenhouse, put a bullet in his brain [^cobain] \\
Snakes in the grass beneath our feet, rain in the clouds above \\
Some moments last forever, but some flare out with love, love, love

[^lovedemo]:
    A [demo](series.html#bible) for Love Love Love was released on Come, Come
    to the Sunset Tree.

[^loveseries]:
    Love Love Love is part of the [informal series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible) and [informal series of

[^saul]:
    [Saul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul) is a major Biblical figure,
    being the first king of Israel after being appointed by the prophet Samuel
    in the 10th century BC. When the Philistines attacked Israel, Saul and his
    army met them at Mount Gilboa, where they were defeated. To avoid capture
    and torture, he fell on his sword.

[^joseph]:
    [Joseph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_(son_of_Jacob)) was a
    Biblical figure sold by his brothers into slavery for twenty silver
    pieces, then faked his death to convince their father. Joseph would
    ultimately rise to be the most powerful man in Egypt after the Pharoah,
    whom he advised.

[^liston]:
    [Sonny Liston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Liston) was a famous
    heavyweight boxing champion. He died a young death, his exact age obscured
    by an unrecorded birthday, of either a heroin overdose, heart failure, or
    murder, depending on which record one believes.

    Sonny Liston ultimately [lost his heavyweight champion title in 1964 to
    Muhammad Ali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_vs._Sonny_Liston).
    During and after the fight, Ali reported stinging in his eyes, and
    believed Liston had put something onto his gloves to blind him. [Tiger
    Balm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_balm), a heat rub used for aches
    and made since the 1870s, has not, to my knowledge, been one of the
    substances which Liston purportedly used; my best guess is that this is
    intended as a stand-in for whatever that substance could have been.

[^raskolnikov]:
    [Rodion Romanovich
    Raskolnikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodion_Romanovich_Raskolnikov)
    is the fictional main character of Dostoyevsky's *Crime and Punishment*.
    In the novel, Raskolnikov, a destitute former law student, murders Alyona
    Ivanovna, a pawnbroker, with an axe, feeling that great men can take
    whatever actions they wish and wanting her money. As his plan
    deteriorates, he also murders her sister. He becomes progressively more
    insane, ultimately confessing after realizing that he will not become
    great, and is sentenced to exile in Siberia.

[^trembling]:
    Also sung with an additional adjective at the end, such as "one by
    trembling one" or "one by twinkling one". American Theater Company,
    Chicago, May 16, 2010; Folk Music Center, Claremont, July 3, 2012.

[^fine]:
    Sometimes sung, "Into a fine and private place", referencing the 17th
    century poem [To His Coy
    Mistress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_His_Coy_Mistress) by Andrew
    Marvell, where the phrase refers to the grave. The poem itself is an call
    to life, with the narrator trying to make the one he loves enjoy their
    love together while they can. The second verse is as follows:

    > But at my back I always hear \\
    > Time's winged chariot hurrying near; \\
    > And yonder all before us lie \\
    > Deserts of vast eternity. \\
    > Thy beauty shall no more be found, \\
    > Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound \\
    > My echoing song; then worms shall try \\
    > That long preserv'd virginity, \\
    > And your quaint honour turn to dust, \\
    > And into ashes all my lust. \\
    > The grave's a fine and private place, \\
    > But none I think do there embrace.

    Black Cat, Washington, DC, October 11, 2004; The EARL, Atlanta, October
    18, 2004.

[^1corinthians1312]:
    A reference to [1 Corinthians
    13:12](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13%3A12&version=HCSB):

    > For now we see indistinctly, as in a mirror, \\
    > but then face to face. \\
    > Now I know in part, \\
    > but then I will know fully, \\
    > as I am fully known.

## Pale Green Things [^palejohn] ## {#pale}

Got up before dawn \\
Went down to the racetrack \\
Riding with the windows down \\
Shortly after your first heart attack \\
You parked behind the paddock \\
Cracking asphalt underfoot \\
Coming up through the cracks \\
Pale green things \\
Pale green things

We watched the horses run their workouts \\
You held your stopwatch in your left hand \\
And a racing form beneath your arm \\
Casting your gaze way out to no man's land [^nomans] \\
Sometimes I'll meet you out there \\
Lonely and frightened \\
Flicking my tongue out at the wet leaves \\
Pale green things \\
Pale green things

My sister called at 3 AM \\
Just last December \\
She told me how you died at last, at last \\
And that morning at the racetrack was one thing I remembered \\
I turned it over in my mind \\
Like a living Chinese finger trap [^fingertrap] \\
Seaweed and Indiana sawgrass [^sawgrass] \\
Pale green things \\
Pale green things

[^palejohn]:
    "This is the thing that was hard to put on The Sunset Tree, I tried to a
    little in the last song on it, because my stepfather, as a number of you
    know, terrorized my family, but if you live in an abusive home, the person
    who abuses you is also your friend and father, and so it's pretty
    complicated, and he would teach me things." --- Buskirk-Chumley Theater,
    Bloomington, April 6, 2009

[^nomans]:
    [No man's land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_man%27s_land) refers to
    contested territory, particularly in warfare, where two groups are
    struggling to control a piece of land. The phrase originates in World War
    I trench warfare, where two dug-in, opposing parties could fight over a
    small piece of land, neither being able to get the upper hand.

[^fingertrap]:
    A [Chinese finger trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_finger_trap)
    is a children's toy that traps the user's finger in a bamboo tube, which
    tightens as one tries to pull their fingers out.

[^sawgrass]:
    Sawgrass, or [Cladium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladium), is a common
    genus of sedge, characterized by sharp edges and long, thin leaves. There
    may be a particular species called Indiana sawgrass, but my best guess is
    that this refers to [Cladium
    mariscoides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladium_mariscoides), a very
    common sawgrass species widespread across the United States.
