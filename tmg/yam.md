    In the liner notes to [Protein Source of the Future...
    NOW!](protein.html), John writes:

    My noble if futile efforts to write a song as good as the Tom Robinson
    Band's "2-4-6-8 Motorway" continue. If cornered, I will admit that *Yam*
    is my favorite Mountain Goats release, so I'm very happy to have it on
    here: it's been out of print for ages. Red gold all over! Somebody catch
    me.

    [2-4-6-8 Motorway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-4-6-8_Motorway) is a
    British rock song charting to the #5 singles position.

[^africanlit]:
    Many songs on Yam, the King of Crops are related obliquely or directly to
    a significant work of African literature. The album title (as well as the
    [eponymous song](#yam) and references in several other songs) is directly
    taken from the seminal work by Nigerian author Chinua Achebe, [Things Fall
    Apart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_Fall_Apart):

    "Share-cropping was a very slow way of building up a barn of one's own.
    After all the toil one only got a third of the harvest. But for a young
    man whose father had no yams, there was no other way. And what made it
    worse in Okonkwo's case was that he had to support his mother and two
    sisters from his meagre harvest... It was like pouring grains of corn into
    a bag full of holes. His mother and sisters worked hard enough, but they
    grew women's crops, like coco-yams, beans and cassava. Yam, the king of
    crops, was a man's crop." (pp. 22 - 23)

    "Yam, the king of crops, was a very exacting king." (p. 33)

IT'S JULY IN CALIFORNIA AND I AM ALL RIGHT.

We are John, Rachel, Sara, Rosanne, and Aaaa-my. It's 1994! Red gold all over!

IF I TELL YOU HUMANO CAPITI CERVICEM PICTOR EQUINAM IUNGERE SI VELIT, ET
CETERA, [^arspoetica] PAL; YOU CAN BELIEVE IT.

Thank you, Jod!

HELLO EVERYBODY

[^arspoetica]:
    These are the opening lines of Horace's [Ars
    Poetica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Poetica#Horace), Horace's
    thoughts on writing good poetry, contained in his second book of Epistles.
    This phrase translates to, "If a painter should wish to unite a horse's
    neck to a human head, and so on." The full paragraph continues:

    "If a painter should wish to unite a horse's neck to a human head, and
    spread a variety of plumage over limbs \[of different animals\] taken from
    every part \[of nature\], so that what is a beautiful woman in the upper
    part terminates unsightly in an ugly fish below; could you, my friends,
    refrain from laughter, were you admitted to such a sight? Believe, ye
    Pisos, the book will be perfectly like such a picture, the ideas of which,
    like a sick man's dreams, are all vain and fictitious: so that neither
    head nor foot can correspond to any one form. 'Poets and painters \[you
    will say\] have ever had equal authority for attempting any thing.' We are
    conscious of this, and this privilege we demand and allow in turn: but not
    to such a degree, that the tame should associate with the savage; nor that
    serpents should be coupled with birds, lambs with tigers."

    Horace. [Ars Poetica](http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/19921).

## Seed Song ## {#seed}

The rain didn't come \\
For one calendar year \\
So when the man with the sunflower seeds in his hand \\
Came here \\
We sent him away \\
We sent him away

The rain didn't come \\
For twelve months more \\
So when the man with the seed catalogs darkened our door \\
We sent him away \\
We sent him away \\
We sent him away \\
We sent him away

And I know you're waiting \\
For the ironic ending \\
And I know you're waiting \\
For the punchline \\
And I know you're waiting \\
For the rain to come by \\
So am I \\
So am I \\
So am I \\
So am I

## Quetzalcoatl Comes Through [^quetzalcoatl] [^throughseries] ## {#through}

He came spitting fire \\
On a day like no other \\
Tried to hold you near to me \\
I heard him passing over \\
He made a banquet for the stray dogs of the air \\
He put our love in clear perspective

Blue, red, and green plumage [^plumage] \\
Trailing behind him now \\
Swaddling the sky in its aftermath \\
The last day coming down \\
He made a banquet for the stray dogs of the air [^dogs] \\
He put our love in clear perspective \\
Rising, rising, rising, rising

[^throughseries]:
    Quetzalcoatl Comes Through is part of the [informal series of Aztec
    songs](series.html#aztec).

[^quetzalcoatl]:
    [Quetzalcoatl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcoatl) is a major
    Aztec diety. Meaning "feathered serpent", Quetzalcoatl is one of many
    winged snake dieties throughout history in South and Central America.

[^plumage]:
    Quetzalcoatl is described as having bright, multicolored plumage, much
    like the [Resplendent
    Quetzal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resplendent_Quetzal) which is
    associated with the god.

[^dogs]:
    I am not sure what this refers to, although it recollects
    [Xolotl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xolotl), the canine Aztec god of
    death and lightning, who escorted the dead to Mictlan, the Aztec
    underworld. Dogs were [strongly associated with the
    dead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogs_in_Mesoamerican_folklore_and_myth#The_Aztecs_and_their_contemporaries)
    in Aztec mythology.

## Omega Blaster [^blasteralpha] ## {#blaster}

You've come back from Yosemite [^yosemite] \\
You brought and aromatic cedar bookmark for me \\
And a brand new stuffed bear \\
It's summertime and you've cut your hair \\
And I am leaving you \\
And I am sorry

You come in through the back door \\
Why do you come in like this, smiling for \\
I have done something I need to tell you \\
I can feel your smile burning through \\
And I am leaving you \\
And I am sorry

[^blasteralpha]:
    Given the similar use of a prefacing Greek letter and the divorce context,
    Omega Blaster is sometimes considered to be an [Alpha couple
    song](series.html#alpha). However, based on the geography and context, I
    don't think this is correct.

[^yosemite]:
    [Yosemite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park) is an
    enormous national park located in the Sierra Nevada mountains of
    California. Renowned internationally for its beauty, especially the
    granite walls of Yosemite Valley and Tuolumne Meadows, it is a Mecca for
    climbers, backpackers, mountaineers, backcountry skiers, and other outdoor
    recreationalists.

## Coco-Yam Song [^cocoyam] ## {#cocoyam}

*"But I'm always true to you darling in my fashion \\
Yes, I'm always true to you darling in my way..."* [^truetoyoujohn] [^truetoyou]

A neighboring clan \\
Went on the attack \\
Stole all the giant coco-yams \\
From the barn out back \\
I will make them pay \\
For taking my yams away

I carved out little figurines of thieves [^fetish] \\
Burned a palmful of red dust from the medicine bag \\
Broke a kola nut in half [^kola] \\
I ate half of it myself \\
I sat back and watching the evening drag \\
I will make them regret \\
That they haven't brought my yams back yet

[^cocoyam]:
    [Taro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taro), also known as cocoyam or
    coco-yam, is a major root crop of Africa, India, and elsewhere. Germane to
    this context, it plays a major role in Achebe's Things Fall Apart, where
    coco-yams are described as an important crop, if less significant than
    yams. While related to the Igbo culture described in Things Fall Apart,
    this scene is not described in the book.

[^truetoyoujohn]:
    John describes this clip as being intended to provide a "stark contrast"
    to the content of the song. [Heavy Metal, Ephemera, and Popular Culture: A
    Chat With the Mountain
    Goats](http://www.spacecityrock.com/issue4/mountaingoats1.html), Space
    City Rock, Spring 2001.

[^truetoyou]:
    This excerpt is from the showtune [Always True to You in My
    Fashion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_True_to_You_in_My_Fashion),
    written by Cole Porter for the Broadway musical Kiss Me, Kate. This
    particular version is that sung by the jazz and pop great Peggy Lee.

[^fetish]:
    Described in numerous world religions, most famously vodou, the creation
    of objects intended to carry magic power over other individuals in a
    community, often by depicting them physically, is known as
    [fetishism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetishism). While not a major
    part of Things Fall Apart, Igbo culture may have incorporated such
    objects.

[^kola]:
    [Kola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_nut) is a caffeinated tree nut
    indigenous to Africa and notable for being the origin of cola as a
    flavoring throughout the world. It is described in Things Fall Apart as
    being a key part of hospitality and many ceremonies, being broken and
    offered to guests or eaten before important occasions.

## Alagemo [^alagemo] ## {#alagemo}

The new rose \\
Floating on water in the old clay bowl \\
The white clouds on the night sky \\
They way they just roll on by \\
Made me think of you \\
And the religious cult of flesh dissolution you've committed yourself to [^alagemo] \\
Alagemo \\
Alagemo

The nightcrawlers [^nightcrawler] \\
Poking their little slimy heads through the dirt \\
Made me think of you again \\
Made me think of you a third time \\
I don't know where you've gone \\
But I hear your voice droning on \\
Alagemo \\
Alagemo

[^alagemo]:
    A reference to the poem Alagemo, by the Nobel laureate author and
    playwright [Wole Soyinka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wole_Soyinka). He
    has been active in political activism in Nigeria, the country of his
    birth, and was imprisoned for several years as a consequence of his
    commitment to justice and independence. Alagemo prefaces his play The
    Road as follows:

    "Since the mask-idiom employed in *The Road* will be strange to many, the
    preface poem Alagemo should be of help. Agemo is simply, a religious cult
    of flesh dissolution." (p. 149)

    The poem itself is as follows (p. 150):

    I heard! I felt their reach \\
    And heard my naming named. \\
    The pit is there, the digger fell right through \\
    My roots have come out in the other world. \\
    Make away. Agemo's hoops \\
    Are pathways of the sun. \\
    Rain-reeds, unbend to me, Quench \\
    The burn of cartwheels at my waist! \\
    Pennant in the stream of time --- Now, \\
    Gone, and Here the Future \\
    Make way. Let the rivers woo \\
    The thinning, thinning Here and \\
    Vanished Leap that was the Night \\
    And the split that snatched the heavy-lidded \\
    She-twin into Dawn. \\
    No sweat-beads droop beneath \\
    The plough-wings of hawk. \\
    No beetle finds a hole between Agemo's toes. \\
    When the whirlwind claps his feet \\
    It is the sundering of the... name no ills... \\
    Of... the Not-to-be \\
    Of the moistening moment of a breath... \\
    Approach. Approach and feel \\
    Did I not speak? Is there not flesh \\
    Between the dead man's thumbs?

## Two Thousand Seasons [^armah] ## {#twothousand}

How have we come to be mere mirrors to annihilation \\
Whom do we aspire to reflect our people's death \\
For whose entertainment shall we sing our agony \\
One hopes that the destroyers aspiring to extinguish us \\
Will suffer conciliatory remorse at the sight of their own fantastic success \\
The last imbecile that dreams such dreams is dead \\
Killed by the saviors of his dreams \\
How have we come to be mere mirrors to annihilation \\
How have we come to be mere mirrors to annihilation

[^armah]:
    The title and these verses are adapted directly from the prologue to the
    novel Two Thousand Seasons by [Ayi Kwei
    Armah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayi_Kwei_Armah), a writer from Ghana.
    The book focuses on the destruction wrought on Africa by colonialism.
    Speaking of such, the original text is as follows (italics present in
    original):

    "*How have we come to be mere mirrors to annihilation? For whom do we
    aspire to reflect our people's death? For whose entertainment shall we
    sing our agony? In what hopes? That the destroyers, aspiring to extinguish
    us, will suffer conciliatory remorse at the sight of their own fantastic
    success? The last imbecile to dream such dreams is dead, killed by the
    saviours of his dreams. Such idiot hopes come from a territory far beyond
    rebirth. Those utterly dead, never again to wake, such is their muttering.
    Leave them in their graves. Whatever waking form they wear, the stench of
    death pours ceaseless from their mouths. From every opening of their
    possessed carcases comes death's excremental pus. Their soul itself is
    dead and long since putrified. Would you then have your intercourse with
    these creatures from the graveyard? Go to them, and speak your message to
    long rotted ash.*"

    Armah, Ayi Kwei (1973). Two Thousand Seasons. Nairobi: East African
    Publishing House.

## Chinese Rifle Song ## {#rifle}

Lay out on the patio \\
Dreaming \\
Lay out on the patio \\
Dreaming \\
And the Chinese rifles sounded in the evening air \\
I heard them popping off everywhere

I lay out on the patio \\
On the chaise lounge \\
I lay out on the patio \\
Where I let my hand rest against the hot redwood frame \\
And the Chinese rifles sounded again \\
I could not stomach their acumen

## Yam, the King of Crops [^africanlit] ## {#yam}

Felt sick, felt good \\
The heat burns with the old wood \\
Muscles in my arms pump like machines \\
The Jericho palm tree [^jericho] is plush and green

Bright sun, the new day \\
I felt sick in a good way \\
Felt the fever climb when you came down \\
All the way across town

And you brought me \\
A plate of sweet potatoes

Sun fading overhead \\
The sunset bright red \\
Your green eyes, your smooth walk \\
Fresh tomato, celery stalk \\
You cook Pari basmati rice [^rice] \\
I felt good, you looked nice \\
You stood like Galatea [^galatea] over me \\
You brought fried garlic and kimchi

And you brought me \\
A plate of sweet potatoes

[^jericho]:
    This is not a variety of palm tree, however, the city of
    [Jericho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho), located in Palestine, is
    known from Biblical times as the City of Palm Trees. These varieties are
    likely [date palms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_palm).

[^rice]:
    [Basmati rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basmati) is an Indian variety
    of long-grain rice. Pari is a brand of rice from India which has been in
    business since the 1700s, formerly as Sachdeva and Sons.

[^galatea]:
    Told in Ovid's poem Metamorphoses,
    [Galatea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatea_(mythology)) is the name
    given to the statue which Pygmalion, a sculptor, makes and then falls in
    love with. On the day of the festival of Venus, he prays for a woman like
    his statue, which comes to life. Pygmalion and Galatea then marry.
