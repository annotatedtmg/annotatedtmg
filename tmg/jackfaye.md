[^johnjackfaye]:
    Jack & Faye was almost lost to history:

    > acowkickedme: I do believe I remember John saying (in some bootleg) that
    > he had left the original copy of the EP in a taxi cab in New York.
    >
    > acowkickedme: Anyone know if this is true?
    >
    > Yeah this is true. January '96, in NY to play at the Knitting Factory
    > (1st KF gig for me ever) and deliver the DAT to the guy who was gonna
    > release it. It must have fallen out of my backpack or something.
    > Fortunately Bob Durkee had made & kept a backup.

    There is a frequently-promulgated fan theory that the name Jack & Faye is
    related to the film
    [Chinatown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(1974_film)), which
    starred Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, but I have found no evidence to
    support this.

[^cover]:
    The official cover art for Jack & Faye [mentioned below](#fn:unreleased)
    has never surfaced. John explains:

    > I *saw* the cover art that was commissioned for the release at one
    > point. but I don't have it, I never had it. it was by this guy though:
    > http://www.lastgasp.com/d/22549/
    >
    > I assume the guy who was going to release the 7" still has it but it's
    > unlikely that I'll ever have it, so it's lost.

    The artist mentioned is
    [Seth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_(cartoonist)), the famed comics
    author and illustrator.

    The cover art frequently associated with the album --- and used here ---
    is by Caliclimber, may he live forever. As excellent as it is, it was
    never officially part of the album release.

[^unreleased]:
    Jack & Faye was never released. John made it available on Nall's website
    in 2001 with the following comment:

    > Jack and Faye was to have been a 7" containing the final recordings by
    > the Mountain Goats of the Sweden/Nine Black Poppies/Nothing for Juice era.
    > There were multiple delays. At one point there was finished artwork. Then
    > there were more delays. Eventually history staked its claim on these
    > recordings and it was almost as though they never even existed at all.
    > Well: here they are, finally, in the mp3 format. Just grab them and they
    > are yours, free of charge. If enough people show interest in obtaining
    > some sort of cover art and liner notes for the Jack and Faye single, this
    > site will eventually provide a "cover" which you'll be able download and
    > print out, either for cassette or CD-R. Express your interest in this
    > possibility by writing to nall@themountaingoats.net.

    > The songs themselves were recorded in December of 1995 and January of 1996
    > in Chicago, Illinois and San Dimas, California. John and Rachel considered
    > them some of their best work and were especially fond of "Raid on
    > Entebbe." Time has given them a somewhat melancholy air. We hope you enjoy

    The songs remain available for download there.

## Raid on Entebbe [^entebbeseries] [^yoyo] [^case] [^entebbe] ## {#entebbe}

On the shores of a lake named after a late queen of England [^victoria] \\
I heard new rumors of war \\
The sun was a red ball up in the summer sky \\
I saw my sister standing in the doorway

She had that look on her face that reminded me of you \\
The reports were coming hourly and the sky was blue \\
They were shifting the power again \\
They always do this when I come home

I tucked my shirt in though I don't know why \\
Shielded my eyes from the light up in the sky \\
'Cause it was shining, blazing [^shifting] like a highway flare \\
In the incredibly, impossibly dry air

I heard my mother call my sister to the kitchen again \\
And thought that everything was heading straight down the drain \\
They positioned themselves in strategic locations \\
I was beginning to lose my patience

If you'll just put your hand in mine \\
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind

[^entebbeseries]:
    Raid on Entebbe is part of the [informal series of alternate
    versions](series.html#demos). Although it itself is not part of the
    [informal series of cover songs](series.html#covers), the live version
    released on the [Yoyo a Go Go 1997 compilation](#fn:yoyo) contained a
    rendition of Joni Mitchell's song [A Case of You](#fn:case), which is part
    of that series.

[^yoyo]:
    A live version of Raid on Entebbe was released on the Yoyo a Go Go 1997
    compilation. The song was essentially identical except for the inclusion
    of an a capella version of Joni Mitchell's [A Case of
    You](#fn:case) at the beginning of the track.

[^case]:
    As mentioned in the [footnotes](#fn:entebbeseries) [above](#fn:yoyo), John
    sings the first two verses of Joni Mitchell's acclaimed 1971 hit [A Case
    of You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Case_of_You) at the beginning of
    the live version released on the [Yoyo a Go Go 1997
    compilation](#fn:yoyo):

    > Just before our love got lost, you said \\
    > I am as constant as the northern star, and I said \\
    > Constantly in darkness \\
    > Where's that at \\
    > If you want me I'll be down at the bar
    >
    > On the back of a cartoon coaster \\
    > By the blue TV screen light \\
    > I drew a map of Canada \\
    > Oh, Canada \\
    > With your face sketched on it twice

    These lines are the same as in the original with the exception of some
    minor grammatical changes; similarly, there are no substantial changes to
    the lyrics of Raid on Entebbe except the one [noted below](#fn:shifting).
    The song was originally released on Mitchell's album *Blue*. She had
    recently gone through a significant breakup with musician Graham Nash (of
    Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young).  Speaking about the album generally, she
    said:

    > The *Blue* album, there's hardly a dishonest note in the vocals. At that
    > period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane
    > wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets
    > from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong. Or to be
    > happy. But the advantage of it in the music was that there were no
    > defenses there either.

[^entebbe]:
    [Entebbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entebbe) is a city in Uganda,
    formerly the capital of Uganda before independence. Situated near Lake
    Victoria, the largest lake in Africa, Entebbe is home to [Entebbe
    International
    Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entebbe_International_Airport),
    Uganda's largest airport.

    [Operation Entebbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Entebbe) was a
    commando operation executed by the Israeli Defence Forces in Entebbe
    International Airport on July 4, 1976. On June 27, members of the Popular
    Front for the Liberation of Palestine --- External Operations and the
    German Revolutionary Cells hijacked an Air France plane headed from Tel
    Aviv to Paris, landing it in Entebbe. The hijackers were welcomed by
    then-dictator of Uganda, Idi Amin, who supported their aims. The
    non-Israeli, non-Jewish passengers were released via a flight to Paris;
    the remainder and crew were held as hostages. The aim of the hijackers was
    the release of 53 Palestinian prisoners and 5 million dollars, threatening
    the hostages with death. The hijacking was not sanctioned by the Palestine
    Liberation Organization; the PFLP-EO is an unaffiliated organization.

    The raid succeeded in rescuing 102 of the remaining 106 hostages, 2 being
    accidentally killed by the commandos, 1 accidentally killed by the
    hijackers, and 1 being left in Uganda as she was in the hospital at the
    time, who ultimately was murdered by Idi Amin's forces. Amin ordered the
    murder of hundreds of Kenyans in retaliation, as Kenya assisted Israel
    with the raid. The raid was widely celebrated by European, Israeli, and
    American media, although it raised controversy in the United Nations given
    its violation of the sovereignty of a UN state and the possibility of a
    diplomatic resolution.

    A film depicting the raid, called [Raid on
    Entebbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Entebbe_(film)) and
    starring Charles Bronson, was produced by NBC in 1977.

[^victoria]:
    [Lake Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Victoria) is the
    largest lake in Africa and third-largest freshwater lake in the world.
    part of the African Great Lakes, Lake Victoria is 209 miles long and 160
    miles wide at its extremes. Entebbe sits on a small peninsula into the
    lake on its northwestern shore.

    Sung as, "'Cause they were shining, shifting like a highway flare" on the
    [Yoyo a Go Go 1997 live recording](#fn:yoyo).

## Adair [^adair] ## {#adair}

I got my eye on the scar \\
That runs clear from your temple to your jawline \\
You'll tell me about all your thoughts right this minute \\
Then I will tell you mine

'Cause I got the wind in my hair \\
And I'm far away from where I used to be \\
But I got all my attention fixed on you \\
And you're flashing that smile at me

With the midwestern sky burning above us \\
We lean up against the car \\
I want to tell you what the sky has done to me \\
I want you to tell me who we are

'Cause I see you raising the water to your lips \\
It's the blazing dead center of July \\
And I got all my hopes hung on your one gorgeous promise \\
And you got the sunlight dancing on your eyes

And I got the wind in my hair \\
And I'm far away from where I used to be \\
But I got all my attention fixed on you \\
And you're just where you said you'd be \\
Just where you said you'd be

[^adair]:
    [Adair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adair_(name)) is an Old English
    surname and the name of [many possible
    places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adair#Places).

## An Inscription at Salonae [^salonae] ## {#salonae}

There was a guy up on the hill \\
With a trumpet to his lips \\
I mean to tell you he knew how to blow that thing

There were women dressed in purple \\
Banging on their tambourines \\
And hammering on cymbals

It was not that long ago \\
When we gathered in the valley below \\
I loved you more than I loved my own life \\
I was falling to pieces

There was a young man on the altar \\
You saw me poised above him \\
I saw you watching me

There were singers, there were dancers \\
There was glittering gold \\
Spring breaking out gradually

It was not that long ago \\
But the memory's kind of dying out, you know \\
Like a flower caught in the overgrowth \\
Falling, falling to pieces

[^salonae]:
    [Salona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salona) was an ancient Roman city
    located in modern-day Croatia, today known as Solin. It was the capital
    city of the region for hundreds of years. An abundance of inscriptions are
    present throughout the city's ruins, the majority with regard to burial.
    The thousands of inscriptions from Salona, many from the city's
    necropolises, are outnumbered only by Rome and Pompeii. Its original
    people, the Illyrians, abandoned the city between 631 and 639.

## There Will Always Be an Ireland ## {#ireland}

Cold northern wind \\
And your young arm \\
Against my face \\
Soft and warm

There will always be an Ireland \\
There will always be an Ireland

Silent hour \\
Worthless words \\
View of some foreign city from the high window \\
Strange black birds

There will always be an Ireland \\
There will always be an Ireland

What we did \\
The things we said \\
Your hand resting \\
On my head

There will always be an Ireland \\
There will always be an Ireland \\
There will always be an Ireland \\
There will always be an Ireland

you probably read that already.
