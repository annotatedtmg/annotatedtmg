## Adultery ## {#adultery}

*"One, two, three, four, one, two."*

There's a mean streak in the sky \\
On the morning when you come by \\
And you ask me, would I? \\
And I say I would \\
And it's an ill wind that does nobody good

And I should've known that you'd come my way \\
By the dogs sprawled out sleeping on the driveway \\
Windows open audibly around the neighborhood \\
It's an ill wind that does nobody good

And you touched my hand \\
And the sun bleeds down \\
Ineffective warnings all over the ground \\
And I'm standing on the same spot where your husband stood \\
It's an ill wind that does nobody good

## Cruiserweights ## {#cruiserweights}

No one of any note is in the crowd \\
Guys in Bermuda shirts are chewing on cigar stubs \\
I get better \\
As I get more worn down

House lights like an amplified inferno \\
PA system borrowed from the high school \\
Breathe through my mouthpiece \\
I hate this town

And there's a whole long list of other things I hate \\
I had to starve myself all week to make weight \\
Cleveland, Ohio \\
1985 \\
Almost out of the woods \\
Awake and alive

Bucket full of blood and dirty water \\
Voices screaming at me from my corner \\
Head for the clutches \\
When I need to buy time

Take a couple of shots right to the liver \\
Then remember what the food was like in prison \\
Stick to the game plan \\
Stall for time

And there's a whole long list of other things to do \\
And the best ones I won't probably get around to \\
Cleveland, Ohio \\
1985 \\
Almost out of the woods \\
Awake and alive

## Only Existing Footage ## {#footage}

Fix the overheads, the glare's become too much at last \\
Have somebody try to boost morale amongst the cast \\
Thermoses of coffee in the frozen dawn \\
Blow a fuse and spend an hour just trying to get the power back on

Space heater starves it out again, something's gotta give \\
Oblivion's been calling since it found out where I live

Try to grab another take before the night descends \\
Blocking's pretty good, but there's a gate hair on the lens \\
And the script girl's wandered off so we improvise the plot \\
Lousy continuity, the coats won't match from shot to shot

Light meter's broken down again, soundtrack doesn't sync \\
Annihilation pouring since it found out where I drink

Red-eye back to Belgrade with the footage we can save \\
End up with one can because the baggage claim's an unmarked grave \\
Hold off the backers, put a notice in the press \\
Oblivion's been knocking since I gave it my address

## Communicating Doors ## {#doors}

Campaign down from Atlanta \\
Five-hour drive to the coast \\
Brought whatever we thought we'd need \\
To pierce the skin of a ghost \\
Met your car at the hotel \\
Rode up seventeen floors \\
And checked ourselves into separate rooms with \\
Communicating doors

Lay on top of the covers \\
Turn the fan up to full \\
Chase a memory around my head \\
Silver, satin, and wool \\
Close the bar at the harbor \\
Say goodnight in the hall \\
Smash the lock with a midnight knock and \\
The rest I don't recall

Stones rise out of the water \\
Water eats at the stones \\
I know people who dig up graves \\
Just to label the bones \\
All that poison we swallowed \\
Seeping out through the pores \\
And floating over the transoms of \\
Communicating doors

## Programmed Cell Death ## {#celldeath}

Up and down the shining aisles \\
The all-night grocery store on Melrose \\
Dozens of us exiles from the mothership \\
The whole wide Western world is at our fingertips

But while the moon hangs high above the city \\
And while the night begins to flex its jaws \\
We meet up like a loose-knit congregation \\
Or like spies who need to pass on information

How much longer are we supposed to stay alive \\
Gathering by the Portuguese sardines in aisle five

Mounds of California avocados \\
Like offerings to an unresponsive god \\
I wore my suit from Hong Kong to the store tonight \\
'Cause it fits me just right

And suddenly the lights out in the parking lot \\
Begin to burst like sodas under pressure \\
One by one they throw themselves against the night sky \\
And almost unremarked upon, the moment passes by

Though one or two of us \\
Point our fingers outside \\
Eyes glazed, mouths wide

Listening to that still small voice within us \\
Doesn't seem to do us any good \\
Try to take that in stride \\
And try to let the moment slide

And we fiddle with our cellphones \\
Until our thumbs are sore \\
And the music on the speakers overhead \\
Is fainter than the voices of the dead

How much longer are we supposed to stay alive \\
Gathering by the Portuguese sardines in aisle five

## How I Left the Ministry ## {#ministry}

There was one thing I found that I couldn't help thinking \\
As they pried me free with the jaws of life \\
None of this disaster would ever have happened \\
If I had not been driving my neighbor's wife

To the Alta Loma Days Inn, where I'd registered us as \\
A couple with a name I'm sure some other couple somewhere has

And the last thing I saw before falling unconscious \\
Was your right hand tracing a heart on my thigh \\
And I thought my God what an infantile gesture \\
And I thought my God what an indescribable high

The autumn air was sweeter than a slice of wedding cake \\
As I overshot the exit and I tried and failed to find the brake

## Some Other Way ## {#otherway}

Test a rope against the ceiling beams \\
I just want to live on in your dreams \\
Crush a vial into a pot of tea \\
I just want you to remember me

But I pour out the pot and I work out the knot \\
'Cause I know that it won't make you stay \\
And I'll be damned if I can't come up with some other way \\
Some other way \\
Some other way to make you love me

Seal the doors and turn the pilot on \\
I just know you'll miss me when I'm gone \\
Drive a fist into a window pane \\
There are things a letter won't explain

But I pick out the glass and I shut off the gas \\
And I look to the oncoming day \\
I'll be damned if I can't come up with some other way \\
Some other way \\
Some other way \\
Some other way \\
Some other way to make you love me \\
To make you love me \\
To make you love me \\
To make you love me \\
To make you love me

## Ambivalent Landscape Z ## {#landscapez}

Out where the water tower climbs, higher than God \\
Crop dust in billowing clouds and the outlaw corn, glinting goldenrod \\
Cold gaze of the universal harvester \\
Glittering on the horizon line \\
Every creature on earth needs a fallout shelter \\
This one's mine

I'll never see you again \\
So until then

Down by the Morton building where I first met you \\
Nothing but energy fields and their bright pink edges doing what they do all day \\
You threw your car keys away \\
You left a bunch of dummy footprints on the clay \\
I try to follow directions as they're printed on the tin but \\
I need a shelter to fall out in

I'll never see you again \\
So until then

## In Germany Before the War [^beforethewarcover] ## {#beforethewar}

In Germany, before the war \\
There was a man who owned a store \\
In nineteen hundred thirty-four [^1934]\\
In Düsseldorf \\
And every night at 5:09 \\
He'd cross the park down to the Rhine \\
And he'd sit there by the shore

I'm looking at the river \\
But I'm thinking of the sea \\
I'm thinking of the sea \\
I'm looking at the river \\
But I'm thinking of the sea

A little girl has lost her way \\
With hair of gold and eyes of gray \\
Reflected in his glasses \\
As he watches her \\
A little girl has lost her way \\
With hair of gold and eyes of gray

I'm looking at the river \\
But I'm thinking of the sea

We lie beneath the autumn sky \\
My little golden girl and I \\
And she lies very still

[^beforethewarcover]:
    In Germany Before the War is a cover of the 1977 song by [Randy
    Newman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Newman), and is part of the
    [informal series of cover songs](series.html#covers).

    A review in the New York Times after its debut on his album
    [Little Criminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Criminals)
    attempts to clarify the topic of the song:

    > Randy Newman's favorite song on the dazzling new "Little Criminals" ...
    > is called "In Germany Before The War," and it gives a brief account of
    > the same Dusseldorf child murderer who figured in Fritz Lang's film "M."
    > The song is stark, very frightening, and deliberately bereft of detail:
    > all we know about the killer is that he sits on the bank of the Rhine at
    > precisely the same time each day, telling himself, "I'm looking at the
    > river but I'm thinking of the sea / I'm thinking of the sea." All we
    > know about him, in short, is that he is in some way removed from the
    > mainstream, just as surely as he is distracted from the Rhine. And it is
    > his sheer strangeness, rather than his depravity, that makes him a
    > fitting subject for Newman's attention.

    Maslin, Janet. [Randy Newman --- The Moral Is
    Implicit](https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/25/archives/randy-newman-the-moral-is-implicit-randy-newman.html).
    *The New York Times*, September 25, 1977, p. 96. Retrieved July 29, 2019.

[^1934]:
    The song is often assumed to refer not only to pre-World-War-II German
    nostalgia, but as [noted in the above footnote](#fn:beforethewarcover)
    also to arsonist, child rapist, and child murderer [Peter
    Kürten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kürten), known as the
    Düsseldorf Ripper. However, he was executed in July 1931, three
    years before this song is set.

    Nonetheless, Randy Newman has introduced the song saying that it is about
    a murderer. See for example [this
    recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JivFpEgbKfw) from Jazzopen,
    Stuttgart, July 26, 2006.

## Tug on the Line ## {#line}

Sun shone down on a cloudless sea \\
And we were out on the water, my father and me \\
With several friends of the family along for the ride \\
And out on the calm water we killed the motor \\
And spread our nets wide

Keep your face to the wind and you'll be fine \\
And wait for the faint tug on the line

Everyone getting restless when we pulled up the net \\
We dropped it down on the deck and everyone's feet got wet \\
And the fish that looked like monsters from way down where the water gets cold \\
Slid down the deck like shuffleboard coasters and made for the hold \\
Everyone's eyes like saucers, nobody saying a word

Keep your face to the wind and you'll be fine \\
And wait for the faint tug on the line

Sailed home in silence across the cold sea \\
Several friends of the family, my father and me \\
And something down below deck that we would try to forget \\
Shapeless and probably nameless as of yet

Keep your face to the wind and you'll be fine \\
And wait for the faint tug on the line

## Rockin' Rockin' Twilight of the Gods ## {#rockintwilight}

Switched on the radio this morning \\
And heard about the local savings and loan \\
How they went under \\
Took with them everything I own \\
That's all right \\
It doesn't make me nervous \\
But I can see the clouds gathering in the distance

And every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven \\
Yeah, every time it rains, I'm a rich man \\
Yeah, every time it rains, I'm indescribably wealthy \\
Yeah, every time it rains, gold coins spill from the heavens straight into my hands \\

Many have said \\
The devil was coming \\
I looked down at the sidewalk through the window \\
Three inches of water running

I looked up at the clouds \\
And everything looked great \\
The Financial News Network \\
Talked about the prime lending rate \\
That's all right \\
I'm safe and warm \\
Just over there you know, near South Ontario \\
I can see the signals of a tropical storm

And every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven \\
Yeah, every time it rains, I'm a rich man \\
Yeah, every time it rains, I'm indescribably wealthy \\
Every time it rains, black checks fall from the heavens straight into my hands

Many have said \\
That the devil was coming \\
I looked down at the sidewalk through the window \\
Three inches of water running

## Dogs of Clinic 17 ## {#clinic17}

Three fresh meals every day \\
And one white pill to chase the chills away \\
And me, I know what it's all about \\
And we all know what it's like to have to go without

Five of us are left, that's down from twenty \\
But the guy in the white coat, he tells me that five is plenty \\
Yeah, one soft bed to rest my head upon \\
And me, I know what side my bread's buttered on

There's a light in the window \\
There's a light in all of us trying to get free \\
There's a light in all of you who hear my song \\
There's a virus eating its way through me
