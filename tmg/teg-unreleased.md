## All Frosting ## {#frosting}

Let's meet out in San Bernardino \\
Let's get a case of Polish vodka \\
Let's bring out the big guns \\
The modified Israeli ones

Let's go back to where we let it all go \\
Let's quit scavenging for bones down in the snow \\
Let's follow the freeway from here \\
Let's disappear

Let's get our stuff back from the pawnshop \\
Let's put a bedroom in the attic \\
Let's stay up real late \\
And see if we don't suffocate

Let's practice our smiles 'til we're they're freezing cold \\
Let's dig up the graveyard 'til we find ourselves some gold \\
I'll tell you when the coast is clear \\
Let's disappear

## Alpha Aquae ## {#aquae}

I've grown rather tired \\
Of our little game \\
You ask me the question \\
My answer's the same

And I couldn't say \\
The day or the year \\
But it must be summer, 'cause there's flies in here \\
I need water \\
I need water

Ants on the window ledge \\
Caught my attention \\
And I wanted to say so \\
But I was too tired to mention it

And we crawled in bed \\
And melted together \\
Cursing each other \\
Cursing the weather \\
And I need water \\
I need water

## Going to California ## {#california}

The boughs hang low \\
And I know \\
Why \\
The apple blossoms are dry

No rainfall \\
No rain this year \\
No rain at all \\
No rain anywhere near here

Skin cracking \\
The skies are clear \\
There's no turning back now \\
But there's no water here

The flashbulb pops \\
But those are some sad looking drops \\
See, that's the useless tractor \\
And over there that's me

Standing on dry land \\
Reaping the dividends \\
Under a cloudless sky \\
Smiling at the camera lens

Skin cracking \\
The skies are clear \\
There's no turning back now \\
But there's no water here

Skin cracking \\
The skies are clear \\
There's no turning back now \\
But there's no water here
