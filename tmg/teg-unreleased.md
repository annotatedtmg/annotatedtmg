## All Frosting ## {#frosting}

Let's meet out in San Bernardino \\
Let's get a case of Polish vodka \\
Let's bring out the big guns \\
The modified Israeli ones

Let's go back to where we let it all go \\
Let's quit scavenging for bones down in the snow \\
Let's follow the freeway from here \\
Let's disappear

Let's get our stuff back from the pawnshop \\
Let's put a bedroom in the attic \\
Let's stay up real late \\
And see if we don't suffocate

Let's practice our smiles 'til we're they're freezing cold \\
Let's dig up the graveyard 'til we find ourselves some gold \\
I'll tell you when the coast is clear \\
Let's disappear

## Alpha Aquae ## {#aquae}

I've grown rather tired \\
Of our little game \\
You ask me the question \\
My answer's the same

And I couldn't say \\
The day or the year \\
But it must be summer, 'cause there's flies in here \\
I need water \\
I need water

Ants on the window ledge \\
Caught my attention \\
And I wanted to say so \\
But I was too tired to mention it

And we crawled in bed \\
And melted together \\
Cursing each other \\
Cursing the weather \\
And I need water \\
I need water

## Going to California ## {#california}

The boughs hang low \\
And I know \\
Why \\
The apple blossoms are dry

No rainfall \\
No rain this year \\
No rain at all \\
No rain anywhere near here

Skin cracking \\
The skies are clear \\
There's no turning back now \\
But there's no water here

The flashbulb pops \\
But those are some sad looking drops \\
See, that's the useless tractor \\
And over there that's me

Standing on dry land \\
Reaping the dividends \\
Under a cloudless sky \\
Smiling at the camera lens

Skin cracking \\
The skies are clear \\
There's no turning back now \\
But there's no water here

Skin cracking \\
The skies are clear \\
There's no turning back now \\
But there's no water here

## \[Sliding Down the Right Pathway\] ## {#pathway}

I came sliding down the right pathway \\
I was shining like a migraine headache \\
I came calling with my voice newly polished \\
My throat was reflecting things you had left in the air \\
And I could taste the air \\
It was hot in my lungs \\
It was strange to be in there without you \\
Light from the window \\
Burns my eyes \\
And that tells me something about you

I sold my soul to the man down the hallway \\
And I crept lightly into the next room \\
What was left of your heartbeat burned so brightly \\
I could feel the light inside, I tightened up inside \\
When I was in the places you had been in \\
I could hear water \\
Like I remembered hearing water around you \\
It came clear in my mind \\
The way the building was set up \\
And that tells me something about you

The traces you left gave off a weird sequence of lines \\
And I marked everything in the building with a mark that only I could recognize \\
And the things in my memory lined up next to each other and they started to burn \\
And then the smell of your hair came alive within in me, I mean it came alive in me \\
When I saw you there \\
Something inside me changed \\
And that's the last time I'll ever doubt you \\
There were animal sounds \\
Ringing within the walls \\
And that tells me something about you
