## Going to California ## {#california}

The boughs hang low \\
And I know \\
Why \\
The apple blossoms are dry

No rainfall \\
No rain this year \\
No rain at all \\
No rain anywhere near here

Skin cracking \\
The skies are clear \\
There's no turning back now \\
But there's no water here

The flashbulb pops \\
But those are some sad looking drops \\
See, that's the useless tractor \\
And over there that's me

Standing on dry land \\
Reaping the dividends \\
Under a cloudless sky \\
Smiling at the camera lens

Skin cracking \\
The skies are clear \\
There's no turning back now \\
But there's no water here

Skin cracking \\
The skies are clear \\
There's no turning back now \\
But there's no water here
