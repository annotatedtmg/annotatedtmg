[^swedenjohn]:
    In an excellent interview with John on VPRO radio (February 17, 2000), he
    describes that he stopped writing Sweden because he couldn't bear to make
    the people in Sweden "suffer any more". He mentions that they show up
    elsewhere, but that in "a couple songs" Full Force Galesburg used a
    different couple that was "a little angrier, and a little less easy to
    sympathize with". Given this description, I think it's safe to say that no
    songs on Sweden describe the Alpha couple.

[^arne]:
    In a particularly amazing live show (Castro Theater, San Francisco,
    December 14, 2010), many songs and outtakes from Sweden or its unreleased
    companion record, [Hail and Farewell, Gothenburg](hafg.html), were played
    live as the score to the Swedish silent film [Sir Arne's
    Treasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Arne%27s_Treasure) for the San
    Francisco Film Society. Songs were not played in order but matched to
    scenes; for example, as Arne's house was burned to the ground by the three
    marauders, John played [Snow Crush Killing Song](#snowcrush), which has
    the subtitle, "[The house was burned down by the young
    man.](#fn:snowcrushsubtitle)"

### Liner notes [^swedensubtitles] ### {#liner}

*(insert):*

"I've had hell inside me. I can spot it in others." \\
--- Eugene O'NEILL, *The Iceman Cometh*, Act Two [^oneill] [^iceman]

"I'm a-going t'make all o' this hum my hum! They's one room hain't mine yet,
but it's a-goin' t'be tonight." \\
--- Eugene O'NEILL, *Desire Under the Elms*, Part Two, Scene Two [^elms]

Ask the typical American what he or she knows about Sweden and you'll probably
be met with a confused, empty sort of look, a shrug of the shoulders, and a
stammering response about Swedish meatballs; ask the typical music fan and
you'll probably hear something about ABBA and Ace of Base; [^thesign] ask me
and I'll start telling you about the Swedish Chef on *The Muppet Show*,
[^chef] who never seemed to get around to making the meatballs but sang better
than all of the members of ABBA and Ace of Base put together.

While our inability to attach any definitive imagery to our conceptions of
Sweden may have something to do with garden-variety American cultural
know-nothingism, it probably owes just as much to the Swedes' oft-overlooked
skill at cleverly obscuring their true nature. Everything about the
Scandinavian country, from its understatedly simple flag design to its
studious neutrality in both World Wars, has been carefully crafted to lull us
into accepting the Swedes as a nation of cheery blue-eyed blondes with nothing
better to do than sip aquavit and eat smorgasbord. Nothing could be further
from the truth.

The fact of the matter is that Swedes are brilliantly cunning and ruthlessly
ambitious. Not all of them are as obfuscatorily fiendish as IKEA founder
Ingvar Kamprad, who grudgingly admitted in November of 1994 that he had
"naively" belonged to a Nazi organization between 1945 and 1948 [^kamprad]
(and whose stores, to my knowledge, have never played ABBA or Ace of Base over
their sound systems, although they do serve Swedish meatballs), but as a rule
it is wise to treat Swedish claims and statements with a certain healthy
skepticism. Official statistics on alcohol consumption, for example, rank
Sweden among the lightest-drinking countries in the world, but this is
characteristically deceptive --- high alcohol taxes make drinking in Sweden
prohibitively expensive, so most Swedes simply hop over the border to either
Finland or Norway and get soused to their hearts' considerable content.
Similarly, the 1986 assassination of outwardly docile Swedish Prime Minister
Olof Palme was originally seen as an act of senseless terrorism but is now
widely acknowledged to have been an ingenious and necessary sacrifice, carried
out with Palme's full cooperation and approval, in order to draw attention to
the high quality of Sweden's long-underrated firearms industry. Even the
Swedish Chef himself, long a staple on *The Muppet Show*, was not fully what
he seemed: close inspection reveals that he was *the only Muppet to have human
hands rather than Muppet hands*, an anomaly that has never been satisfactorily
explained and whose secret apparently went to the grave with honorary Swede
Jim Henson in 1990. [^chef]

Such inscrutability, coupled with a national history dotted with
character-building ordeals like the Stockholm Bloodbath of 1520, the Thirty
Years War of 1618--48, and the Linköping Cannibalism Outbreak of 1926,
[^ordeals] adds up to a juggernaut in the making. Americans would be wise to
protect their collective flank and pay heed to the warning recently issued by
the Swedish rock band Whale, whose 1994 "Hobo Humpin' Slobo Babe" single
contained the following backwards-masked message: "We will bury you... bury
you." [^whale]

*(CD booklet):*

Mark GIVENS painted the front cover at which we are awed and for which we are
grateful. [^givens] The back cover is from Marcella ZITA's Walking on Snow,
maybe the best film I've ever seen. [^zita]

Thanks to the Swedish Army, Special Forces Unit: Liz, Dan, Danielle, Dennis,
Giana, Paul, Gary, and Kurt. Very special thanks to the monkeys for playing on
the coconuts with their little hands on the Neon Orange Glimmer Song.

The Mountain Goats are John and Rachel. Fergus is completely out of his mind.

[^swedensubtitles]:
    On the insert to Sweden describing the song list, each song has a
    subtitled line in Swedish following the title. These are transcribed with
    each individual track rather than the liner notes. Translations are from
    Jordan Ellenberg, as provided to Nall and found on [Nall's Sweden
    page][nall]. I'm not sure how these relate to the songs themselves.

    Swedish does not have the letter "ÿ", which appears in the [subtitle for
    Downtown Seoul](#fn:seoulsubtitle). [Called the "tyskt
    y"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ü#U-umlaut), or "German y", when it
    appears in Swedish loanwords, it is not part of the Swedish alphabet and
    generally only appears in German words. "Yngre", meaning "younger", is
    usually spelled without the umlaut. I'm not sure what this implies about
    the origin of these Swedish words.

    The liner notes were written by Paul Lucas. Zoop II, Farm Sanctuary, New
    York, June 13, 2009.

[^oneill]:
    Both quotes are from [Eugene
    O'Neill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_O%27Neill) plays, a Nobel
    Prize in Literature winning realist playwright from New York City.

[^iceman]:
    [The Iceman Cometh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Iceman_Cometh) is a
    play (and later, a film) about the denizens of a bar. Set in 1912, the
    film has many political themes while discussing the despair in the lives
    of those at the bar.

[^elms]:
    [Desire Under the
    Elms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_Under_the_Elms) is another play
    adapting parts of the tragedy of Phaedra, a Greek myth, to 1920s New
    England. Originally told by Euripides and Seneca the Younger, the married
    Phaedra falls in love with Hippolytus, who rejects her. Phaedra then
    claims to her husband, Theseus, that Hippolytus raped her, resulting in
    his death. In the O'Neill play, the husband is instead cuckolded,
    resulting in a child, which the wife murders in an attempt to continue her
    affair.

[^thesign]:
    John's love of [Ace of Base's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_of_Base)
    song The Sign is known to many fans; a studio version is recorded on Songs
    for Peter Hughes (and later, Bitter Melon Farm), and John has played his
    cover live at over a dozen shows. John has described himself as an
    [ABBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABBA) fan as well, see for example
    Bullseye, Sound of Young America, April 7, 2011.

[^chef]:
    The [Swedish Chef](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Chef) is a Muppet
    who sings in fake Swedish while making a slapstick parody of actual
    cooking. His signature phrase, "Børk, børk, børk!" includes ø, a letter
    not actually present in the Swedish alphabet. Performed by puppeteer Jim
    Henson, the Swedish Chef did in fact use Henson's hands rather than puppet
    hands to make it easier to manipulate cutlery.

[^kamprad]:
    The Swedish furniture store tycoon [Ingvar
    Kamprad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingvar_Kamprad) did indeed admit to
    such a claim. After the leader of the fascist and Nazi-supporting New
    Swedish Movement died, his letters revealed that Kamprad had been involved
    with the organization in the 1940s.

[^ordeals]:
    The [Stockholm
    Bloodbath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_Bloodbath) was a
    massacre of Swedes following with invasion of Denmark in November 1520.
    The [Thirty Years' War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years'_War)
    was an enormous religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics,
    which involved much of Scandinavia in the 1620s and 1630s. The Linköping
    Cannibalism Outbreak of 1926 appears to be made up.

[^whale]:
    Hobo Humpin' Slobo Babe was an alternative rock track by
    [Whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_(band)), as described,
    charting into the top 10. It is not purported to have any backmasking in
    it, to my knowledge.

[^givens]:
    Givens also painted the cover of [Beautiful Rat Sunset](brs.html) and is
    likely the namesake for [Song for Mark and Joel](brs.html#markjoel).

[^zita]:
    John mentions that he's lost touch with Zita and doesn't know where to
    find this film anymore in his [interview with Space City
    Rock](http://www.spacecityrock.com/issue4/mountaingoats1.html) (2001). I
    have been unable to find any further information about Zita or Walking on
    Snow, but would love to hear more if you know something. My best guess is
    that Zita is another local from the Inland Empire scene. Zita also
    contributed the cover to [Zopilote Machine](zopilote.html#fn:zita).

### Related material ### {#related}

Sweden has one major outtake, I've Got the Sex. It is also intimately related
to its sequel, the unreleased album [Hail and Farewell,
Gothenburg](hafg.html). John has also played several unreleased outtakes of
unknown names, which have been named by their tapers as \[Horse and Master\],
\[I Might Compare\], \[Let Me Go\], \[One Frozen River Stuck in Time\],
\[Shield My Eyes Against the Glare\], and \[Slip Away From Me\], based on
their lyrics.

## The Recognition Scene [^recognitionjohn] [^recognitiondefinition] [^recognitionsubtitle] ## {#recognition}

We broke the doorknob off of the door \\
The door swung open easily \\
You sauntered into the poorly lit store \\
And looked around lazily \\
We stole every bit of candy they had inside \\
Gobbled it all up greedily on our three-month ride [^ridelength] \\
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone \\
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone

We headed out to the getaway car \\
And hit the open road \\
I saw something written in tall clear letters on your face \\
But I could not break the code \\
We had hot caramels sticking to our teeth \\
And the only love I've ever know burning underneath \\
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone \\
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone \\
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone \\
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone

[^recognitionjohn]:
    John describes this song and [Sept 19 Triple X Love! Love!](#sept19) as
    being companion pieces. He continues: "This song is about that moment when
    --- let's say you'd been assembling a model... so you've been following
    the directions, and as the model begins to take shape, you see that the
    shape, while it is a distinct and easy-to-identify shape, is not the same
    one that was on the box. And it's gonna eat you alive. You didn't know it
    was that kind of model. If you had known, you wouldn't have bought it."
    --- Terrastock II, Custer Avenue Stages, San Francisco, April 17, 2013

    A similar description: "This is a song... that's about a point in time
    when everything sacred goes profane." --- Cat's Cradle, Chapel Hill, North
    Carolina, January 27, 1999

[^recognitiondefinition]:
    A [recognition scene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagnorisis) is a term
    from plays where a character realizes the situation they're in or
    otherwise has a major epiphany related to their plight.

[^recognitionsubtitle]:
    Subtitle: "Vi skulle gå hem, forren det regnar." Translation: "We were
    going home before a rain."

[^ridelength]:
    Sometimes sung live with a different duration. For example, at Cat's
    Cradle in 1999, John sings "five-month ride".

## Downtown Seoul [^seoulsubtitle] [^seoul] ## {#seoul}

There was a new song on the air \\
I saw you coming across the square \\
And a white bird broke the dark Korean sky \\
As the rest of my life went by

You had your warm hand on my face \\
I took your index finger in between my teeth \\
And I held it gently in place \\
It was resting lightly on my tongue in there \\
I saw you shaking in the cold Korean air \\
There but for the grace of the lord of song [^bradford] \\
I would be this very second and I'm coming right along \\
You had your cardigan on

I looked toward the sky and the white bird was gone \\
I remember your eyelids \\
I remember your body now

[^seoul]:
    [Seoul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul) is the capital and largest
    city of South Korea.

[^seoulsubtitle]:
    Subtitle: "Han ar ÿngre an jag." Translation: "He is younger than me."

[^bradford]:
    This bears a remarkable similarity to the famous expression, "There but
    for the grace of God goes John Bradford", sometimes altered to, "There but
    for the grace of God go I". The idiom is attributed to the Protestant
    martyr [John Bradford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bradford), who
    was said to utter this saying as he saw criminals being executed prior to
    his own burning at the stake by Mary I of England.

## Some Swedish Trees [^treessubtitle] ## {#trees}

*"One, two, one, two, three, four..." \\
"Oh, you don't want to start like that, you want me to do the thing." \\
"That's not how we ever start."*

Well, you were standing in the door \\
Well, I wondered what you were waiting for \\
I saw the wild strawberries on the vine \\
Out of control

Well I was trying to think of something clever \\
You were saying nothing whatsoever \\
I saw the berries throw their hooks into the soil \\
Felt the blood between us churning thick as motor oil

We'd come from California \\
The air around you was familiar to me now \\
If you were gazing westward \\
I was looking at you again

## I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone [^wonderseries] [^johnson] [^wondersubtitle] ## {#wonder}

*"I who have sat by Thebes below the wall \\
 And walked among the lowest of the dead."* [^tseliot]

All I know \\
Is I'm in love you \\
Even though \\
You say that we are through \\
I know without your love \\
I just can't go on \\
I wonder where our love has gone

Always thought \\
You'd love me more and more \\
Never dreamed \\
You'd ever let me go \\
I know without your love \\
I just can't go on \\
I wonder where our love has gone

Now, what did I do \\
And what did I say \\
That ever could leave you \\
To treat me this way \\
If I've been untrue \\
I'm willing to pay \\
And darling, if that's not enough I'll do anything you say

So darling, please \\
Wherever you may be \\
Hear my plea \\
And hurry home to me \\
I know without your love \\
I just can't go on \\
I wonder where our love has gone

    poem is from part three, The Fire Sermon. While I am not completely
    certain that this is the same recording, one recording of Eliot reading
    The Waste Land which sounds very similar is available from the [Internet

## Deianara Crush [^deianara] [^deianarasubtitle] ## {#deianara}

One day in September \\
You come here \\
You pull my head down \\
And you whisper in my ear

And you tell me the sidewalk \\
Is as far as the world really goes \\
But that's a secret \\
Everybody knows

You hold my head in your hands \\
You say my name \\
How is it that though you say it some twenty-thousand times \\
It's never quite the same

And you tell me that Hercules \\
Died burned consumed by an article of his own clothing [^deianara] \\
That's something \\
I'd rather not be reminded of

[^deianarasubtitle]:
    Subtitle: "År du inte min van?" Translation: "Aren't you my friend?"

[^deianara]:
    [Deïanira](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deianira), meaning

    [Women of Trachis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_of_Trachis),
    Hercules killed the centaur Nessus with a Hydra-poisoned arrow when Nessus
    attempted to steal Deïanira. As he died, Nessus told Deïanira to give
    Hercules a shirt painted with his blood to prevent him from being
    unfaithful. When she did so, the Hydra poison killed Hercules, burning him
    alive. Deïanira subsequently committed suicide.

## Whole Wide World [^worldsubtitle] ## {#world}

The last of the repercussions \\
Died off real slow \\
The sky was still \\
And the cold sun sank down beneath the snow

I hung by my hand \\
From the tree outside \\
And I looked on the whole wide world

The voices came quietly \\
I shut them down \\
A tricky young southernly wind \\
Came at me with its high whistling sound \\
I turned around to face it \\
With real arrogance burning inside \\
And I drank in the whole wide world

## Flashing Lights [^lightssubtitle] ## {#lights}

I am wearing \\
A white long-sleeve button-down \\
The pink colors behind the clouds tonight \\
Mirror the softer shades of your nightgown \\
As the neurotransmitters go crazy inside of me  \\
You swear you're leaving town \\
Empty promises \\
Empty promises

I am watching \\
The way the wind seems to pass straight through your body \\
When you run your fingernail along my neck \\
And you spill some water on me \\
You say you're as good as gone \\
Well, don't look now, but here comes the dawn \\
Empty promises \\
Empty promises \\
Empty promises \\
Empty promises

## Sept 19 Triple X Love! Love! [^sept19john] [^sept19] [^sept19subtitle] ## {#sept19}

*"I bet you don't know..."* [^duffus]

I cut down that withered peach tree \\
Just like you asked me to \\
And I hacked it into pieces \\
Set it on fire with your face in plain view \\
At the near window where you stood \\
Watching me split the wood \\
I will do as I am told \\
I will keep away the cold

The fire pit in the snow \\
Gave off a rich bright orange-red glow \\
And a familiar scent rose up into the air \\
And I remembered something special from a long time ago \\
You opened up the door \\
Stepped away from the killing floor \\
Your footprint on the snow was fresh and new \\
When you touched me I felt fire coming through \\
I will do as I am told \\
I will keep away the cold \\
I will do as I am told \\
I will keep away the cold

## Tahitian Ambrosia Maker [^tahitiantitle] [^tahitiansubtitle] ## {#tahitian}

We were real hungry and half dead \\
When you broke out half a loaf of sourdough bread \\
And in the tropical air the scent rose like a spirit \\
Moments of grace like this being wholly unmerited \\
Ah

We were newly alive and I felt your hand on my arm \\
I was awake to the sensation and immune from all harm \\
You pressed your soft cheek up against my gut \\
Pure gold, nothing but gold \\
And I'm gonna bake you a nice coconut cream pie \\
'Cause I saw the sky coming down to meet you

I cut myself a two foot switch [^switch] \\
From some tropical hardwood nearby \\
And the sounds of a carnival drifted miraculously \\
Through the air from a thousand miles away \\
The monkeys jumped from tree to tree \\
It sent a deathly chill through me \\
In Bolivia

Wildcats I had never seen \\
Claimed places in my room \\
And animal noises rang through the thick brush \\
Like voices from the tomb \\
I saw the freshly-polished chrome \\
Gleaming in the midday sun \\
And I knew that you were coming home \\
To Bolivia

    > There's no mercy, which makes your love more strong \\
    > To love that well, which you will have to leave before too long \\
    > La la la la la la la \\
    > La la la la la la la la la

    At Mains d'Oeuvres, Mofo Festival, Paris, France, June 27, 2003 and Empty
    Bottle, Chicago, October 14, 2005:

    > Dog-tired, suisired, will now my body down \\
    > Near Cedar Avenue in Minneap \\
    > Where the used cars live \\
    > When my crime comes \\
    > When my crime comes \\
    > When my crime comes \\
    > When my crime comes \\
    > When, when

    At Berbati's Pan, Portland, October 3, 2003:

    > I, I will be king \\
    > And you, you will be queen \\
    > Nothing can drive them away \\
    > We can beat them just for one day, one day

    At Court Square Theater, Harrisonburg, April 4, 2003:

    > We sat at the window looking out \\
    > And the rain came down like silken string that Swithin's day \\
    > Nothing to read, nothing to say \\
    > Seemed in that room for her and me \\
    > We were irked by the scene, by our own selves, yes \\
    > She did not read, nor could I confess \\
    > How much there was to read and guess \\
    > By her in me, nor could be a crown in it \\
    > Wasted were two souls in their prime \\
    > And great was the waste at July time \\
    > When the rain came down

    At North Star Bar, Philadelphia, September 22, 2007:

    > This is my Father's world \\
    > And to my listening ears \\

    > This is my Father's world \\
    > This is, this is, this is, this is my Father's world \\
    > This is, this is, this is my Father's world \\
    > Why must I then be sad \\
    > In the tall, tall grass I hear him pass \\
    > This is my Father's world, my Father's world \\
    > Yeah

    These stanzas are from Shakepeare's Sonnet 73, John Berryman's The Poet's
    Final Instructions, David Bowie's "Heroes", Thomas Hardy's We Sat at
    the Window, and the hymn This Is My Father's World, respectively.

    In full, Shakespeare's [Sonnet
    73](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet_73) reads (with the relevant lines
    in the final couplet):

    > That time of year thou mayst in me behold, \\
    > When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang \\
    > Upon those boughs which shake against the cold, \\
    > Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. \\
    > In me thou seest the twilight of such day, \\
    > As after sunset fadeth in the west, \\
    > Which by and by black night doth take away, \\
    > Death's second self, that seals up all in rest. \\
    > In me thou seest the glowing of such fire, \\
    > That on the ashes of his youth doth lie, \\
    > As the death-bed whereon it must expire, \\
    > Consumed with that which it was nourished by. \\
    > This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong, \\
    > To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.

    [John Berryman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Berryman) poem, The
    Poet's Final Instructions, goes as follows:

    > Dog-tired, suisired, will now my body down \\
    > near Cedar Avenue in Minneap, \\
    > when my crime comes. I am blazing with hope. \\
    > Do me glory, come the whole way across town.
    >
    > I couldn't rest from hell just anywhere, \\
    > in commonplaces. Choiring & strange my pall! \\
    > I might not lie still in the waste of St Paul \\
    > or buy DAD's root beer; good signs I forgive.
    >
    > Drop here, with honour due, my trunk & brain \\
    > among the passioning of my countrymen \\
    > unable to read, rich, proud of their tags \\
    > and proud of me. Assemble all my bags! \\
    > Bury me in a hole, and give a cheer, \\
    > near Cedar on Lake Street, where the used cars live.

    John's use borrows from the first and last stanzas.

    Third, the stanza in question is from the chorus of David Bowie's
    signature 1977 song
    ["Heroes"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Heroes%22_(David_Bowie_song)):

    > I, I will be king \\
    > And you, you will be queen \\
    > Though nothing will drive them away \\
    > We can be heroes just for one day \\
    > We can be us just for one day

    Forth, [Thomas Hardy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy) 1875
    poem We Sat at the Window:

    > We sat at the window looking out, \\
    > And the rain came down like silken strings \\
    > That Swithin's day. Each gutter and spout \\
    > Babbled unchecked in the busy way \\
    > Of witless things: \\
    > Nothing to read, nothing to see \\
    > Seemed in that room for her and me \\
    > On Swithin's day.
    >
    > We were irked by the scene, by our own selves; yes, \\
    > For I did not know, nor did she infer \\
    > How much there was to read and guess \\
    > By her in me, and to see and crown \\
    > By me in her. \\
    > Wasted were two souls in their prime, \\
    > And great was the waste, that July time \\
    > When the rain came down.

    [This Is My Father's
    World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_My_Father's_World) is a
    popular Christian poem and hymn by Maltbie Davenport Babcock published in
    1901 and written in the late 19th century. Originally a lengthy poem, it
    was shortened to fewer verses when first set to music in 1916 by Franklin
    L. Sheppard, and is now sung with a variety of similar verses. For
    example:

    > This is my Father's world \\
    > And to my listening ears \\
    > All nature sings and round me rings \\
    > The music of the spheres
    >
    > This is my Father's world \\
    > I rest me in the thought \\
    > Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas \\
    > His hand the wonders wrought
    >
    > This is my Father's world \\
    > He shines in all that's fair \\
    > In rustling grass I hear him pass \\
    > He speaks to me everywhere
    >
    > This is my Father's world \\
    > Why should my heart be sad \\
    > The Lord is King, let heaven ring \\
    > God reigns; let earth be glad

## California Song [^californiajohn] [^californiasubtitle] ## {#california}

I know you can see Mars \\
In the sky tonight \\
I know you can see Venus rising \\
And veering off to the right \\
Can you see that young star overhead \\
It's the one that designed my undoing

I know that in California \\
The waves break on the beach \\
And I know that the foam on the breaking waves \\
Is as white as household bleach \\
But do you see that particular white right now \\
It's the color of the young star, coming on down \\
I got joy, joy, joy in my soul tonight \\
I got joy, joy, joy in my arms all right \\
Although you treat me badly \\
I love you madly \\
You really got a hold on me \\
You really got a hold on me [^smokey]

    young, and it's awesome to be in love, and it's awesome that we're both
    here in this town, and it's so nice.' And that's what this song is about."

You come at me with all your hot lights on display \\
I know you're changing \\
Damn you \\
I know you're changing \\
God damn you for that

God damn you

I went down to the basement \\
To check up on the sour mash [^mash] \\
I looked down to the nonreactive ceramic tub \\
It was bubbling \\
I had stirred up the dust on the stairs coming down \\
I saw the dust devils swarming around \\
Incoming sunbeams cut them apart \\
And I watched a shadow pass across my heart \\
You were upstairs in the kitchen \\
With your head against the sink \\
Trying to cool down \\
Trying to cool down

I know you don't believe me, but I could hear you breathing \\
I looked into the tub and there the mixture was seething \\
With new life, new life all around \\
I stirred up the dust on the stairs coming down \\
You were upstairs in the kitchen \\
With your head against the sink \\
Trying to cool down \\
Trying to cool down \\
Yeah
