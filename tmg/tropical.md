[^tropicaljohn]:
    In the liner notes to Ghana, John writes:

    > I've actually become a belated convert to the Church of the Mozzer, and
    > regret going public with my ignorance of his excellence. Posterity is its
    > own punishment, I suppose. The real loss, though, is that I can't include
    > "Unforgivable Stuff" from the Furniture Huschle side of the record: "Then
    > there's the time I came home drunk / I bit your arm and got a chunk / how
    > was I to know the infection would spread? / the serious doctor said the
    > tissue was dead / but now the stump is healing and it don't look bad /
    > yeah, when the going gets rough / we bring up that unforgivable stuff."
    > Why this single didn't chart in at least fifteen countries remains a
    > mystery to me.

    Mozzer refers to [Morrissey](#fn:morrissey), whom John states his distaste
    for in [Anti Music Song](#antimusic).

[^split]:
    Tropical Depression is a split EP with labelmate and longtime Inland
    Empire musician friends Furniture Huschle. Their tracks, Mercury Bobcat
    and Unforgivable Stuff, are not discussed here.

[^covers]:
    Due to a misspelling on the cover, a second version of Tropical Depression
    was released, identical except for the cover image.

[^cyclone]:
    As [described in the liner notes](#liner), a [tropical
    depression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Tropical_depression)
    is the lowest classification of cyclone, in which wind speeds are lower
    than 34 knots, no eye is present, and the storm is not well-organized, but
    a low-pressure system is present.

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

Date: 08/01/96 \\
To: Little Mafia Records \\
From: Joel R. Huschle
RE: Furniture Huschle/Mountain Goats Split 7"

A tropical cyclone passes through two stages, tropical depression and tropical
storm, before reaching hurricane force. The two stages can be viewed as sides,
like sides of a record. Let me take you back to the year 1994. Imagine
standing on the mangrove-lined [^mangrove] coastline of Belize, [^belize] your
shirt nearly ripped off your body by powerful winds. The rain, driven hard by
the hot moist air, tears little holes in your skin. Each little hole, when
looked into with a powerful camera, looks like the hole in the middle of a
record. You now have that record in your possession. The first side is by
Furniture Huschle, presenting two distinct songs, each with its own music and
lyrics. The second side is by The Mountain Goats, going the extra mile with
three songs (again, these are three distinct songs, each with its own music
and lyrics). That's five *different* songs! All songs were assembled by Bob
Durkee, who owns and operates the assembler of the songs. This e.p. was
supposed to have come out on a British label in 1994, but that label put out a
Merzbow [^merzbow] album instead. So open your turntable and get ready to
change the weather. You wil no doubt feel the hot moist air weight heavy in
your lungs. You will look with a powerful camera into the holes in your
skin...

[^mangrove]:
    [Mangroves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove) are trees in the family
    Rhizophoraceae, and especially *Rhizophora*, although sometimes the term
    refers to the swampy, saline, coastal biome in which mangrove trees are
    found.

[^belize]:
    [Belize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize) is a small, coastal country
    on the east coast of Central America bordered by Mexico and Guatemala.

[^merzbow]:
    [Merzbow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merzbow) is a prolific Japanese
    noise musician and author. As far as I can tell, the only British label
    Merzbow released an album or EP on in 1994 was [Ten Bob
    Swerver](http://www.discogs.com/label/23641-Ten-Bob-Swerver), a very minor
    label with only two releases, neither of them related to the Mountain
    Goats, so my best guess is that this is just a joke.

## Anti Music Song [^antimusicjohn] ## {#antimusic}

*"Anti Music Song."*

I saw you on TV \\
Doing a bad imitation of Van Morrison [^morrison] \\
And I saw you on TV \\
Doing a bad imitation of a second-rate songwriter from the eighties named Morrissey [^morrissey] \\
I never liked Morrissey \\
And I don't like you

I saw you on TV \\
Doing an imitation of an imitation of Jimi Hendrix [^hendrix] \\
That's really pathetic \\
And I saw you on TV \\
Trying to figure out what Brian Jones [^jones] would be like if he'd have lived 'til today \\
I can tell you myself \\
He'd be like Brian Wilson [^wilson] \\
I don't like Brian Wilson \\
And I don't like you \\
I don't like you

[^antimusicjohn]:
    John has refused to play this song, saying that he no longer agrees with
    it. "\[Anti Music Song\] I no longer agree with the premise... I have
    grown to love both Morrissey... and Mark Eitzel, and I can't sing that
    song in good conscience anymore." --- American Theater Company, Chicago,
    May 16, 2010

    I'm not sure which line is directed at Eitzel.

[^morrison]:
    [Van Morrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Morrison) is an acclaimed
    Northern Irish musician famous for a large body of successful rock and pop
    work, especial his 1968 and 1970 releases *Astral Weeks* and *Moondance*.

    John has stated that this line was directed at [Adam
    Duritz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Duritz) of the Counting Crows, a
    position which I hope he has recanted similarly to the rest of the song.

    and songwriter who rose to fame with alternative, indie pop band The
    Smiths in the 1980s, and who has since also been successful with his solo
    efforts.

    John states that he has recanted his position on Morrissey in [the liner
    notes](#fn:liner), [at shows](#fn:antimusicjohn), and on the forums: "I
    don't even remember who the Morrissey wannabe was. It should be noted that
    I saw the light in '95 and would no longer call Moz '2nd-rate.'"

[^jones]:
    [Brian Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Jones) was one of the
    founders of the Rolling Stones, contributing tremendously to the young

    musician famous for his work with the Beach Boys, where he was the primary
    songwriter, arranger, and one of the main vocalists.

    This is one line in the song John hasn't repudiated: "no, I still dislike
    BW's entire body of work pretty intensely".

## Going to Hungary [^hungaryseries] [^hungary] ## {#hungary}

We touch down \\
In Budapest [^budapest] \\
Headed straight for the motel room \\
We got undressed

We had not slept \\
For three or four days \\
We slipped underneath the covers \\
It felt OK

About twelve hours later \\
The sun came out to play \\
I felt it on my eyelids \\
I pushed your hair away

You put on your old gloves \\
You put on your new skirt \\
I put on my cowboy boots \\
I slipped on my yellow shirt

We headed out, sweat drying on our bodies \\
And I got all sentimental \\
We were heading straight to hell \\
In a Lincoln Continental [^continental]

## Earth Air Water Trees ## {#earth}

Through the shifting colors in the sky \\
I heard the wild geese call \\
And the light was bright and clear and cold \\
Over eastern Montreal [^montreal] \\
And although I know \\
You're only toying with me now \\
And although you hold \\
Your affection from me like a bone on a string \\
I love you, I love you because \\
You gave me sausage and cheese \\
When I was hungry

But you hold your closed hand out to me \\
You told me to guess what you had inside \\
And I had a thousand guesses and some of them were good \\
But I knew for sure that I was losing my mind \\
When the scent came rising \\
Through the spaces between your fingers \\
When the scent called to me \\
And I knew we'd last at least 'til the end of December \\
And I love you, I love you because \\
You gave me sausage and cheese \\
When I was hungry

[^montreal]:
    [Montreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal) is the largest city in
    Quebec, close to the American border with Vermont.
