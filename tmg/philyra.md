[^philyra]:
    [Philyra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philyra_(mythology)), the Greek
    word for the linden tree, could refer to several different Greek mythological
    women. The most famous, however, would be to refer to Philyra, the water
    nymph and Oceanid (daughter of the Titans) who gave birth to Chiron, the
    famous centaur.

    In Protein Source of the Future... NOW!, John writes, "The record's title
    means 'lime tree' in Latin; the eight-line poem by Horace on the back of
    the sleeve is just unbelievably good, worth any amount of effort you might
    put into figuring out what it means. The whole record, actually, is full
    of puns for real and would-be classicists, each of which was greeted by
    the ocean of silence I've come to enjoy." Not being a classicist, I'm
    personally still struggling through the references --- if you get them,
    please [get in touch](../about.html#contact).

[^protein]:
    Philyra was also rereleased in full as part of the Protein Source of the
    Future... NOW! compilation in 1999.

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

Montium custos nemorumque, Virgo \\
quae laborantes utero puellas \\
ter vocata audis adimisque leto, \\
diva triformis,

imminens villae tua pinus esto, \\
quam per exactos ego laetus annos \\
verris obliquum meditantis ictum \\
sanguine donem.

--- Horace <span style="text-decoration:underline">Carmina</span> III:XXII.
[^horace]

Next week's topics: Cybele as Whetstone; [^cybele] root-systems. Hey.

[^horace]:
    Translated, this passage reads:

    Holy Virgin, guardian of the mountains and the groves, \\
    to whom young women in labor \\
    pray, you who hear and save them from death, \\
    triple goddess

    bless this pine tree that overhangs my villa, \\
    and gladly at each year's end I will present to it \\
    the blood of a young boar \\
    still practising its sidewise slash.

    This passage is dedicated to
    [Diana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(goddess)), the Roman diety.
    It is taken from the [Odes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odes_(Horace))
    of Horace, a collection of poems published in the 10s and 20s BC.

## Third Snow Song [^yevtushenko] ## {#third}

In January \\
I took a short walk \\
Down to the Broadway Bridge [^broadway] \\
Two and a half blocks \\
When you scrape the ice away \\
You can read the bridge dedication [^dedication]

I could feel the cold air \\
Coming in through my teeth \\
I saw the bridge \\
I saw the water underneath \\
That's a whole lot of water \\
That's a whole lot of water

I took out the key \\
That I'd forgotten the function of \\
Twisted it from the keyring \\
As the bridge moved above \\
I hammered it against the ice \\
I hammered it against the ice

[^yevtushenko]:
    Regarding Snow Song, John wrote, "This song's title is, for me, a generic
    term with a very specific purpose. I use it when I've written a song whose
    mood reminds me, either lyrically or musically, of the winter I spent in
    Portland, Oregon, a season during which I almost died at least twice." I
    presume that this song shares this naming schema and therefore similarly
    refers to the disastrous year of methamphetamine use in Portland that led
    to [We Shall All Be Healed](wsabh.html) and many other songs. Bitter Melon
    Farm liner notes.

    Prior to discovering this, I hypothesized that the title was potentially
    related to *Третий снег*, Russian for *The Third Snow*, a collection of
    political poetry by poet [Yevgeny
    Yevtushenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Yevtushenko). Written
    in 1955, it was one of his earliest publications in what would be a
    lengthy career of art opposed to the Soviet establishment. At this point,
    my best guess is that this similarity is coincidental.

[^broadway]:
    Many bridges are named the Broadway Bridge. However, especially given the
    description of the bridge moving (indicating a drawbridge), I think it's
    most likely that this refers to either the [Broadway
    Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_Bridge_(Manhattan)) which
    crosses the Harbor River Ship Canal in northern Manhattan or the
    [Broadway Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_Bridge_(Portland))
    spanning the Williamette River in Portland.

[^dedication]:
    Given that I'm not sure which bridge this is, I can't be sure which
    dedication this is. However, should it be Portland's Broadway Bridge, the
    dedication might be [this
    plaque](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BroadwayPlaque.JPG). I was
    unable to find a more concrete dedication or any plaque whatsoever in the
    case of the Manhattan bridge.

## The Monkey Song [^monkeyjohn] ## {#monkey}

Cool air falls through the Venetian blinds [^venetian] \\
And the planets in the heavens are perfectly aligned \\
I take in my surroundings \\
I memorize them all \\
The scuff marks on the stone floor \\
The powder burns on the eastern wall

There's a monkey in the basement \\
How did the monkey get there \\
There's a monkey in the basement \\
Where did the monkey come from \\
Where did the monkey come from \\
Where did the monkey come from

The animal noises you used to make \\
The Andalusian coral snake [^snake] \\
All pale when standing beside this room \\
And the heavy hot rains and the sonic boom

There's a monkey in the basement \\
Where did the monkey come from \\
There's a monkey in the basement \\
How did the monkey get there \\
How did the monkey get there \\
How did the monkey get there

[^monkeyjohn]:
    "This is a totally stupid song. I mean it." --- 40 Watt Club, Athens,
    Georgia, August 10, 2006

[^venetian]:
    [Venetian blinds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_blind#Venetian) are
    horizontally-aligned blinds which can be opened or shut by twisting a
    control rod.

[^snake]:
    I'm not aware of a coral snake native to Spain. However, the [coral
    snakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_snake) are a family of
    poisonous snakes known to grip a victim while injecting its neurotoxic
    venom.

## Love Cuts the Strings ## {#strings}

First thing that happened was the river overflowed \\
The water running through the streets, it was sweet and cold \\
I knelt by the water like a doe by a stream \\
Punch-drunk, snowblind, as though the whole thing were a bad dream

And then love called out the heavy artillery \\
And Kypris [^kypris] took the horses by the bit for the morning ride
    [^chariot] \\
I count my blessings but you can only be expected to count so high \\
When love cuts the strings

I smeared myself with pennyroyal [^pennyroyal] to keep the hounds at bay \\
And you poked your head out from an alley half a block away \\
And I recognized you, though I'm not sure how \\
And the air turned red around you as a dull chill came down over me

And then love summoned up the infantry \\
And the green-eyed goddess got ready for all-out war \\
I count my blessings but I don't even know what the word blessing means \\
When love cuts the strings \\
Yeah

[^kypris]:
    Another name for [Aphrodite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite), the
    Greek goddess of love.

[^chariot]:
    The only story I am aware of regarding Aphrodite and horses regards
    [Glaucus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucus_(son_of_Sisyphus)), who
    angered the goddess during a chariot race. In retribution, she killed him
    by causing his chariot to crash in the race. However, Aphrodite herself
    was not riding the horses; more likely, I think, is that this does not
    refer to a particular Greek myth.

[^pennyroyal]:
    [Pennyroyal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentha_pulegium) is an extremely
    pungent flowering plant with a minty scent.

## Pure Honey [^honeyseries] ## {#honey}

I had a thousand good questions I was \\
Gonna ask you when you finally came by \\
But now that you're really here there's only \\
One question that comes to my mind

That question being \\
What's with all the Portuguese Water Dogs? [^waterdogs] \\
I'd like to repeat the question \\
What's with all the Portuguese Water Dogs?

[^honeyseries]:
    Pure Honey is part of the [Pure ... series](series.html#pure).

[^waterdogs]:
    [Portuguese Water Dogs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Water_Dog)
    are small working dog breed from Portugal originally bred to help
    fishermen.
