[^tepeyollotl]:
    I'm not sure who the cover depicts. One possibility would be
    [Tepeyollotl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepeyollotl), the Aztec jaguar
    god. Tepeyollotl was a manifestation of Tezcatlipoca, the primary deity in
    the Aztec pantheon, and was associated with the night. His name in Nahuatl
    translates to "Heart of the Mountains". Another possibility would be a
    [jaguar warrior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_warrior) or other
    person dressed in a jaguar skin.

    I make this association primarily due to the spotted feline pelt the
    person is wearing and the image's visual similarity to the depiction of
    Tepeyollotl in the [Codex
    Telleriano-Remensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Telleriano-Remensis),
    where he holds a staff similar to that seen here. I don't really know
    though, so if you do --- or have a better hunch --- I'd [love to hear from
    you](../about.html#contact).

*(reissue booklet):* [^reissue]

The songs you find on this compact disc originally appeared on two cassettes.
To elaborate further about that --- to say, for example, that the songs
originally appeared "on two cassettes that were released in \_\_\_\_ and
\_\_\_\_" --- would misrepresent the spirit of their time. These tapes did not
have release dates. No-one anticipated their coming into the world, and very
few noticed or cared. Among those who did, reaction was fairly evenly split.
Some people thought these tapes were kind of cool. Other people thought they
sucked. One can make, without much effort, a good case for either side of the
proposition.

All previous eras cross at some point into the territory of the unimaginable,
and so it is with the days of tape-trading. The obscurity in which these songs
were incubated & born & brought into their faint light is a state of being
which has passed into history. I don't keep diaries and I have a pretty
hostile mistrust of nostalgic impulses, so anything I remember about these
songs is shaded by having grown from the excitable young would-be poet &
terrible guitarist who wrote them into the excitable less young would-be poet
& improving guitarist who writes today. If I could speak to that younger
writer, I would explain patiently to him that stalker narrators are neither
interesting nor edgy, so he might want to refrain from writing "The Garden
Song," lest his feminist activist older self feel embarrassed in the future.
Through the impenetrable calcite wall of time I am pretty sure I can hear the
younger writer responding that he sees my point, but that there is also a song
about cows.

## The Garden Song [^gardenjohn] ## {#garden}

*"Where's Spike when you need him? Huh?" "I'm warning you." "You? Warning me?"
"Cut it out!"*[^976-evil]

I see the flowers in your garden are in bloom \\
I see the flags are flying high \\
I hear you've gone and rearranged things in your room \\
I guess you're trying to cut off my air supply

I came toward your window real slowly \\
I knew deep down I was about to strike oil \\
I guess by now the flowers in your garden know me \\
I felt them trying to get at me through the soil

My bare feet felt the cool, soft dirt moving up my ankles \\
But I don't fear you \\
The thorns began tearing at my shirt \\
But I didn't even care when they tore clear through

Your garden can't hurt me \\
Your flowers don't threaten my life \\
Your garden can't hurt me anymore \\
Your flowers don't threaten my life

[^gardenjohn]:
    As described by John in the [reissue liner notes](#liner), the narrator
    here is a stalker. See also Gold Student Center, Claremont, December 2,
    2006.

[^976-evil]:
    Taken from the 1988 horror B-movie
    [976-EVIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/976-EVIL). The film revolves
    around two unlikable teenagers: Spike, a rebellious motorcyclist, and
    Hoax, his frequently-bullied cousin. Both live with Hoax's zealously
    Christian mother, Lucy. The boys find 976-EVIL, a novelty horoscope
    hotline that appears on the surface to simply provide dark advice, but in
    actuality is operated by Satan to possess the living. Hoax uses the
    hotline to kill his enemies, ultimately becoming possessed by Satan. In
    the end, a pit to Hell emerges in the mortal realm, and Hoax is destroyed
    when he falls into it, pushed by Spike, who realizes that he is beyond
    hope of saving. The film bombed on its commercial release, and has never
    gained any significant critical acclaim.

    These lines come from a scene approximately 45 minutes into the film,
    right after two skaters who frequently bully Hoax see him in the corner of
    the school bathroom. They threaten to beat him up, realizing that Spike
    isn't around to protect him. Hoax is initially scared, but he harnesses
    the power of Satan, warning them that he intends to fight back --- the
    point at which this exchange occurs between one of the bullies and Hoax.
    Immediately after these lines, Hoax turns his hands into claws, deeply
    cutting the face of one bully and scaring off the other.

## Going to Wisconsin [^wisconsinseries] ## {#wisconsin}

*"Oh yeah, th---"* [^ohyeah]

There was the sound of a lake boiling over \\
On that day \\
Everyone said just to sit still \\
But the thickening air got in my way

So the hook's been baited now \\
Yeah, the cheese is on the water \\
Yeah, the water's been cleansed of all impurities, but \\
But now it really doesn't matter \\
Let's go, let's go

Wisconsin bound \\
Wisconsin bound \\
Wisconsin bound \\
Wisconsin bound

The bottom of the boat was a hot plate come alive \\
But the boat wasn't real and this is how I feel \\
You don't know where you are until you arrive [^going] \\
And the frogs sang out from the distant banks \\
And you say you need me in California but no thanks

Wisconsin bound \\

Wisconsin bound

Let's go

## Spilling Toward Alpha [^spillingseries] ## {#spilling}

I hear you moving in the hallway \\
I hear you sharpening your claws \\
I hear you polishing your teeth sometimes \\
But I don't mind

And I hear you out in the garage \\
I hear you messing with the motor \\
I hear you tinker with the engine sometimes \\
But I don't mind

And I hear you moving in the kitchen \\
I hear you in there late at night \\
I notice when you leave the gas jets on sometimes \\
But I don't mind

## Alpha Negative [^negativeseries] [^catalina] ## {#negative}

The house was pretty and the yard was wide \\
And I felt strong with you at my side \\
Your eyes at night had a beautiful glowing in them \\
And I knew in my heart just what was growing in them

Ah, but you made me drink poison \\
It felt smooth running down my throat \\
I love you, and you made me drink poison \\
It was cool and smooth and sweet, do you remember

We had a bed of daisies thriving in the yard \\
And I quit my job so I could hold you all the time \\
I tried to stop the thing metastasizing in us \\
But in the warm, slow evening, I could feel it rising in us

Ah, and you made me drink poison \\
It felt so smooth sliding down my throat \\
I love you so much, and you made me drink poison \\
It was cool and smooth and sweet and cool and smooth and sweet and cool and smooth

*"We'll just try that again."*

## The Torch Song [^torchsong] ## {#torch}

The sun was coming up and our friend was sound asleep \\
But we saw through the window that the water ran so deep \\
That you couldn't make out the ocean floor \\
Then I saw you in the light, I couldn't take it anymore

Give me your hand \\
Give me everything you've got \\
And the light from the window will fall on us burning hot \\
Just like a torch

The air was humid, I will not forget \\
When we stepped outside I hear your footstep \\
Now in my mind, it's a soft sound \\
Almost imperceptible against the giving ground

Let me kiss your eyelids with my lips \\
Let me feel the heat coming off your fingertips \\
Just like a torch

[^torchsong]:
    A [torch song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torch_song) is any song to an
    unrequited love, so-called as the singer is "carrying a torch" for the
    person. A number of films, plays, and songs include the phrase in their
    titles. Most notably in regards to the Mountain Goats, [Torch
    Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torch_Song_(film)) was a 1953 musical
    starring Joan Crawford. The film, based on a short story by I.A.R.  Wylie,
    follows Jenny Stewart (played by Crawford) as a lonely, mean, and
    perfectionist Broadway star and her eventual love of her blind pianist.
    The film was Crawford's last for MGM.

    It's unclear if this is related somehow to this song, but given John's
    love of Joan Crawford and fondness for endings I can't imagine he was
    unaware of the film.

## טקש [^sheket] ## {#sheket}
{: style="unicode-bidi: bidi-override; direction: ltr;"}

You've been away for quite some time \\
And now the rules are different now, everything's mine \\
Backtrack, hey say, what's the problem \\
Here's the problem, everything's mine

I can't be quiet \\
I can't be quiet anymore \\
I can't be quiet \\
I can't be quiet anymore \\
Yeah

You've been away for quite some some time \\
And now the rules are different now, everything's mine \\
Backtrack, hey, what's the problem \\
Here's the problem, everything's mine

I can't be quiet

[^sheket]:
    שקט, romanized *shekeṭ* and pronounced *ʃɛkɛt* (*SHEH-ket*), is Hebrew for
    "quiet" or "tranquility". The spelling is clearer on the compilation
    reissue, where it's typed rather than handwritten. You may see some
    writings on the Mountain Goats (including [Nall's
    site](http://www.themountaingoats.net/lyrics/hound_lyr.html#ape)) calling
    this song "Ape" given the appearance of the letters.

    It's not clear to me whether this is in verb form ("be quiet"), noun form
    ("quietness"), or adjective form ("it is quiet"). Hebrew speaker Sophie
    Kreeger writes:

    > The wonderful thing about this word, and about Hebrew in general, is
    > that the combination of letters shin-kuf-tet (שקט) could be any of the
    > three parts of speech you proposed (noun, verb, adjective), depending on
    > context and vowels.
    >
    > The noun, sheket, is spelled exactly the same as the verb, shakat, and
    > the adjective, shaket --- they only differ by vowels, which we generally
    > omit in written Hebrew. So, the vowelled versions of the three words
    > would be: שֶׁקֶט (noun: shé-ket), שָׁקֵט (adjective: shá-ket), and שָׁקַט (verb:
    > shá-kát). As you can see, without vowels all three words look just the
    > same: שקט.
    >
    > Based on the context--the lyrics of the song--I think we could justify

    > The noun, sheket, we could translate as "quiet" or "silence" or
    > "stillness."  The adjective, shaket, could mean "quiet" or "silent."
    > And the verb form, shakat, would translate to "he was quiet" or "he was
    > silent" or, more poetically, "he quieted."

    Thank you to Sophie for this thoughtful analysis!

    Hebrew is written right to left, therefore the letters in order of
    pronunciation should be <span style="unicode-bidi: bidi-override;
    direction: ltr;">ש--ק--ט</span> (shin--qoph--tet). If you have a
    Unicode-compliant browser these letters will be rendered with shin on the
    right and tet on the left --- this is the correct spelling of the word.

## Going to Mexico [^mexicoseries] ## {#mexico}

I saw you at your window \\
I saw you in the sun \\
I saw you at your window \\
Looking out

I reached my hand in there \\
Then I touched your hair \\
And felt myself burn in the morning

And the chickens were screaming \\
Black dog at my heels \\
And the bluejays were coughing \\
Up in the trees

I'd forgotten my name \\
I felt kind of ashamed \\
And felt myself burn in the morning

I saw you at your window \\
At the beginning of summer \\
And invisible stars \\
Sent their heat down

I imagined your touch \\
It was almost too much \\
Burned like a bonfire in the morning

    and the [informal series of alternate versions](series.html#demos).

[^nfj]:
    Like [Alpha Double Negative: Going to Catalina](petronius.html#catalina),
    Going to Kansas was rerecorded for the later album [Nothing for
    Juice](nfj.html). The Nothing for Juice version removes the [intro from
    Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones](#fn:jimjones), uses electric
    guitar, and has Rachel Ware on backup vocals. Apart from a few minor
    wording changes, the lyrics are the same.

[^jimjones]:
    These lines come from the award-winning 1980 television miniseries [Guyana
    Tragedy: The Story of Jim
    Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana_Tragedy:_The_Story_of_Jim_Jones).
    The film chronicled the story of the People's Temple cult, led by Jim
    Jones, and their eventual mass murder-suicide in 1978 by drinking poisoned
    Flavor Aid (often reported as Kool-Aid, and leading to the popular phrase,
    "drinking the Kool-Aid", meaning to uncritically accept a dangerous idea
    due to social pressure). 918 people died, 278 of them children, and 908 of
    them United States citizens, then the largest single loss of civilian life
    from a deliberate act in American history. A Californian Congressman, Leo
    Ryan, who was there to investigate the cult, and four other people were
    murdered as they attempted to leave. Jones had been accused of numerous
    counts of sexual abuse of members, punishments amounting to torture,
    loyalty tests where he compelled members to attempt suicide to prove their
    commitment to him, preventing people from leaving the encampment, and
    other violations of human rights.

    The mass suicide was prompted by Congressman Ryan's investigation and the
    abandonment of the People's Temple by some members, who attempted to leave
    with Ryan. Believing that this would destroy Jonestown --- despite Ryan's
    relatively positive view of the encampment --- Jones ordered the mass
    suicide, and his members attempted to violently stop the Ryan delegation
    from leaving, murdering Ryan and four other people with him.

    In the film, these lines are stated as he starts to believe that Jonestown
    will be doomed due to the eventual report of the Ryan delegation and the
    members who left Jonestown, just before he orders the mass suicide.

## The Water Song [^water2] ## {#water}

*\[speech in other language\]* [^unknownlanguage]

Water came springing out the side of the wall \\
And I guess the same thing will happen to us all \\
I don't know how to explain what I mean \\
I mean to say it's kind of hard to explain

Now \\
Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me

Water came down through the cracks in the ceiling \\
But this time the water had a different feeling \\
It's the sort of feeling that is hard to explain \\
So let me put it to you in a different way

Now \\
Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me

You're the salesman, I'm the buyer \\
You're the tractor, I am the tire \\
I'm the glass, you're the water that fills me \\
I hear them coming, now let them kill me

Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me, now \\
Let them kill me \\
Yeah

Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me

## Going to Spain [^spainjohn] [^spainseries] ## {#spain}

*\[speech in other language\]* [^unknownlanguage2]

It's heaven up here, but it's \\
Heaven down there, and \\
You're gonna leave me now \\
I don't care

It's heaven outside, but it's \\
Heaven indoors, well \\
Go on and leave me \\
I don't care anymore

I hear the airplane coming \\
I hear the airplane coming \\
I hear the airplane coming now \\
It can't touch me

I see you going up the \\
Little stair \\
Go on and board the plane \\
I don't care

I, I see you hold his hand \\
I see you wave goodbye \\
I don't know you anymore \\
So I'm not going to cry, now

I see the airplane coming \\
I feel the airplane coming \\
I hear the airplane coming now \\
It can't touch me

## Keep It on Your Mind [^keepseries] [^hankwilliams] ## {#keep}

*"It's a quarter 'til 2 on the 23rd of February and this is a Hank Williams
song."*

Now, if you stay out and start playing around \\
Your baby's gonna burn [^tear] your playhouse down

You better keep it on your mind [^allthetime] \\
You better keep it on your mind \\
You'll be a-moaning and a-groaning, Lord \\
You better keep it on your mind

Now, wrong is wrong, and right is right \\
If you make a pig mad, [^snake] he's sure gonna bite

You better keep it on your mind \\
You better keep it on your mind \\
I've had it proven to me, Lord \\
You better keep it on your mind

Every fuss [^woman] got the same old end \\
I don't believe the good Lord meant for a man to win

You better keep it on your mind \\
You better keep it on your mind \\
You'll be a-groaning and a-hopping, Lord [^blue] \\
You better keep it on your mind

Now, if she gets mad and tells you goodbye \\
There ain't a thing that you can do but sit at home and cry

You better keep it on your mind \\
You better keep it on your mind \\
You better call her sweet mama, Lord \\
You better keep it on your mind [^extrastanzas]

[^keepseries]:
    Keep It on Your Mind is part of the [informal series of cover
    songs](series.html#covers).

[^hankwilliams]:
    [You Better Keep It on Your
    Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Better_Keep_It_on_Your_Mind) is a
    song by Hank Williams and Vic McAlpin, released as a single in 1954 after
    Williams' death of heart failure.

[^tear]:
    Sung, "Your baby's gonna tear your playhouse down" in the original.

[^allthetime]:
    The original Hank Williams track featured backing vocals singing, "All the
    time" after the first two lines of the chorus.

[^snake]:
    Sung, "If you make a snake mad..." in the original.

[^woman]:
    Sung, "Every fuss with a woman's got the same old end" in the original.

[^blue]:
    Sung, "You'll be singing blue and lonesome, Lord" in the original.

[^extrastanzas]:
    The original track contained two additional stanzas:

    > If the judge says pay her forty dollars a week \\
    > You'll dig up the money or you'll work the streets \\
    > You better keep it on your mind \\
    > You better keep it on your mind

    > When you're wearing striped britches, son \\
    > It's gonna stay on your mind

    > So kiss her every mornin' and love her every night \\
    > Boy you can't win no matter if you're right

    > You better keep it on your mind \\
    > You better keep it on your mind \\
    > You better heed this warning, Lord \\
    > You better keep it on your mind

    I imagine John removed these lines as well as [the one above](#fn:woman)
    given his feminist beliefs.
