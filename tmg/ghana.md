[^ghana]:
    [Ghana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana) is a country located on the
    coast of western Africa in the Gulf of Guinea. The lines on the cover that
    go across the central southern part of the country are a map of the
    Ghanian railroad system, operated by the [Ghana Railway
    Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana_Railway_Corporation)
    since 1898.

__YOU FOUL SPIRIT OF INFIRMITY__ [^luke1311]

Among my many obsessions is a guy named Bob Larson, [^larson] who's like a
televangelist, except he lacks the dubious gift that makes for good
television; certain kinds of charisma are better suited to less aggressively
"hot" media, such as radio or print, and Bob Larson is a case in point. His
own personal crusade involves the devil, and the many ways in which Mr. Larson
perceives the devil to be making inroads into our once-proud Christian
culture. He seems to have cut his teeth on heavy metal, in the wild and free
days of the mid-eighties, when guys with big hair were pied-Pipering the
children down a gilded path to the open mouth of Gehenna [^gehennom] while
their naive parents reassured one another with rationalizations. "It's just a
phase," Mom says to Dad; "We had our music, and Jenny has hers," Dad says to
Mom as Jenny's adjusting her spiked collar before the bathroom mirror, gearing
up for the big Testament/Nuclear Assault [^testament] double-bill tonight at
Fender's in Long Beach. [^fender]

Meanwhile, per Bob Larson, the Lord of All Fevers and Plagues [^lord] is
readying himself for the feast of souls. Time is of the essence. Somebody must
be saved, and soon, or all will be lost. Lost! Naturally this was and is
nonsense, as a brief moment's thought will reveal to any open mind. If the
televangelists who believed in the God-defeating power of backwards masking
were right, then all the young men and women who banged their heads to
Mercyful Fate [^fate] and did not subsequently answer and alter-call to repent
should by now be living horrendous and infernal lives. While we here at
Mountain Goats HQ lack the funding to carry out the painstaking research that
would determine the question once and for all, I'm going to go out on a limb
here and say that most unsaved ex-metalheads are probably doing just fine, and
that God has not turned His indescribable Gaze away from them. No one can read
the Mind of the Infinite, but it's probably safe to say that some guy from
Denmark singing about Satan in an eardrum-rending falsetto isn't actually of
much lasting spiritual importance.

But Bob Larsen has a radio show, and has written (or commissioned and
ghost-written) plenty of books besides, and he seems fairly confident that
demons travel through circuitry and speakers into the mortal souls of
unsuspecting music listeners. We have been putting this theory to the test for
years now, but have yet to reap any of the rumored rewards. Every last song on
this record contains some permutation or other of a backwards-masked message
whose gist is "He Who Was Banished into the Pigs That Ran Straightaway Into
the Water commands you to send the Mountain Goats some really cool Asian pop
CDs or cassettes, sooner rather than later, preferably that terrifying
bubblegum stuff from Japan or Thailand." [^pigs] To date only three people
have responded. Good sign? Bad sign? The Sign? [^sign] It is hard to say. Here
are the rest of the singles and compilation appearances, at any rate. I cannot
promise you that playing them all backwards won't result in the opening of a
portal into the Realm of Them Who Got No Faces. You are on your own here. Some
of my very favorite songs follow. I earnestly hope you enjoy them.

--- John Darnielle, Ames, Iowa, July 2001

This is 3BOS 1003.2. Released in 2002.

I don't suppose I could possibly convey here just how badly I want to make my
thank-yous read like the credits from an album by Ratt or some similar, less
known hair band. You know what I mean: "Special thankz to everybody who's
stayed with us all the way to the top!!! We won't ever forget ya!!! To our
moms: Love ya!!! You know it!!! To my little bro Davey: Told ya!!! See you at
Deke's in late April... know what I mean!!!" and so forth. The lines you've
just read, in fact, were the beginnings  of just such an endeavor, but I lost
my nerve. This, from the guy who since 1994 has played the same Ace of Base
song at least a hundred and fifty times in public and never once apologized
for it. Thanks to Tim Adams for his long-standing support of this whole
project; to everybody who released the records on which these songs originally
appeared, including but not limited to Dennis Callaci, Gregor Kessler, Brad
Rose, Frank van den Elzen and Fred Maessen, Russell Hill, KSPC, Paul Lukas,
Dan Sutton, Joel Huschle and Dan Varenka. Bottles of tequila to Chris Butler
and Jon Nall for supplying source material when it turned out that the master
tapes had all been sold to pawn shops during a blackout somewhere in the
course of yet another season-long buying spree of limited run special editions
from small private distilleries. Thanks to the nation of Ghana for lending its
name to this collection. I know, I know: a lot of you are probably thinking
right now: "Why Ghana? Why not the Ivory Coast, or Kenya? Is there something
we should know?" Yes, there is. There is something you should know. I thank
you for asking. Gotta say whut's up to my boys down at Lord Charley's! You
know I don't miss spraying down those Yorkshire Pudding baking cups ha ha ha
ha ha!  Steve and Makan you know you're mission the kitchen! Aw Yeah! Thanks
most of all to God #1 for seeing us through. To all the people who didn't
believe: you know what time it iz! Awwww, yeah! And so on.

This is volume three of three compilations of Mountain Goats songs that have
graced various formats and labels over the years.

*(back):*

*Fig. 3* The White River Monster, [^monster] photographer unknown. Of special
note is the absence of any properly monsterlike figure despite the scene's
generally monstrous feel. Recommended musical accompaniment: Frank Sinatra's
"Summer Wind". [^summer]

[^linerseries]:
    The liner notes to Ghana are part of the informal [series of Biblical
    references](series.html#bible).

[^songselsewhere]:
    A good deal of the liner notes are explanatory comments on individual
    songs or groups of songs, or comments on other releases. These are
    footnoted with those songs or releases rather than being transcribed here.

[^luke1311]:
    A reference to the suffering of an old woman, whom Jesus heals. The phrase
    originates from[Luke
    13:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2013:11&version=KJV):

    > And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen
    > years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.

    King James Version, retrieved October 31, 2014.

[^larson]:
    [Bob Larson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Larson) is an American
    televangelist. Like other televangelists, he performs religious services,
    appears on television and the radio, and performs exorcisms, often for a
    large fee.

[^gehennom]:
    [Gehennom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gehenna) is a site outside of
    Jerusalem which the Bible describes as being the site of ritual sacrifice
    of children by burning to Ba'al, Moloch, and other gods of Canaan.
    Accordingly, the location is purported to be cursed, and the term is also
    used to refer to an afterlife for evil people.

[^testament]:
    [Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testament_(band)) is an
    Californian thrash metal band. [Nuclear
    Assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Assault) similarly is a
    thrash metal band from New York.

[^fender]:
    [Fender's Ballroom](http://www.classic-rock-concerts.com/venues/3554) was
    a punk and metal club in Long Beach, California, from 1984 to 1989,
    closing after being declared a public nuisance.

[^lord]:
    Lord of All Fevers and Plague is a track off of the debut album of Florida
    death metal band [Morbid
    Angel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbid_Angel), titled [Altars of
    Madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altars_of_Madness).

[^fate]:
    [Mercyful Fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercyful_Fate) is a Danish
    black metal band.

[^pigs]:
    A reference to the [Exorcism of the
    Gerasene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism_of_the_Gerasene_demoniac),
    a miracle of Jesus told in the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke, in
    which Jesus casts the demons Legion out of the body of a man. At the
    demons' request, they enter a herd of two thousand pigs, who drown
    themselves in a nearby lake.

    Later, [Pigs That Ran Straightaway Into the Water, Triumph
    Of](wsabh.html#pigs) would become a Mountain Goats song on the album We
    Shall All Be Healed.

[^sign]:
    Referring to [The Sign](peter.html#thesign), a blockbuster pop hit by
    Swedish band Ace of Base, covered by the Mountain Goats numerous times and
    with a released version on the Songs for Peter Hughes EP, and alluded to
    again later in the liner notes.

[^monster]:
    The [White River
    Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_River_Monster) is a supposed
    water monster living near the White River in Arkansas. Some
    cryptozoologists claim that the monster might have been an elephant seal,
    however, that claim also stretches some credulity.

[^summer]:
    Originally written by Heinz Meier and Johnny Mercer, [Summer
    Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Wind) is a hit 1965 song
    recorded by Wayne Newton. Its most famous version was played in 1966 by
    Frank Sinatra, charting even higher than Newton's original hit. The song
    has had many covers over the years.

## Golden Boy [^goldenjohn] [^goldenseries] [^object] [^goldenboy] ## {#golden}

*"Hello there, Paul. [^lukas] I had a take and I listened to it and I was
ready to send it, and I thought, 'You know, it can be done better.' So, here
it is then. Now I'm wearing my boots, which always guarantees a good
showing."*

You must try to lead a good life \\
You must do unto others as you would have them do [^goldenrule] \\
So that when you die, you'll find Golden Boy peanuts \\
Waiting in the afterlife for you

There are no pan-Asian supermarkets down in Hell \\
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts \\
There are no pan-Asian supermarkets down in Hell \\
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts \\
Yeah

If thine enemy oppresseth you [^jeremiah] \\
You must let him oppress you some more \\
So that when you go shopping in paradise [^eternity] \\
You'll find those magnificent peanuts from Singapore

With the drawing of the young Chinese farmer \\
The eastern sun behind him, smiling at you from the shelves [^strolling] \\
If we want to spend eternity in happiness \\
Well, we're gonna have to watch ourselves

You must give to the March of Dimes [^dimes] \\
You must be on guard against wickedness at all times \\
And you will find that your efforts have brought you great joy \\
When your spirit is munching on that Golden Boy [^shade]

There are no pan-Asian supermarkets down in Hell \\
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts there \\
But the streets of Heaven are lined with shelves \\
And there's billboards of the Golden Boy everywhere

There are no pan-Asian supermarkets down in Hell \\
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts \\
There are no pan-Asian supermarkets down in Hell \\
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts \\
Go

    "Sometimes backwards masking isn't necessary, of course; sometimes you
    just want to evangelize outright. People get mad when they request this
    song and I say I don't know how to play it. I don't, though. I wrote it in
    one sitting while my wife was in Thailand recruiting soldiers for our Army
    of Radio Shack Pastry Chefs. I can tell you now, though, that hand-held
    keyboards taste awful with or without a delicious peanut sauce." --- Ghana
    liner notes

    "On returning to my hometown of Claremont, California, on the occasion of
    a friend's wedding in July of 1997, I was greatly saddened to learn that
    the Bang Luck Market had closed. Since the early '80s the Bang Luck had
    been the only Asian market east of the San Gabriel Valley that could lay
    true claim to the title 'Supermarket.' They had it all at the Bang Luck:
    Filipino canned goods, Korean ramen, Thai medicinals, Vietnamese pickled
    jackfruit, Japanese candies, and Golden Boy Peanuts, which were remarkable
    for their packaging, for their country of origin, and for the inclusion of
    'salt' in the listed ingredients. I ate hundreds of them on numerous and
    diverse occasions, and I can assure you that no jury in the world would
    convict them of having been salted." --- Object Lessons: Songs About
    Products liner notes

    "This is a rather stupid song." --- Amoeba Music, San Francisco, August
    22, 2006. See also Swedish-American Hall, San Francisco, February 25,
    2009.

    "I remember the moment when I consciously decided to stop writing songs of
    that nature. And like, only do them when sort of, there was, you know, an
    occasion for it. I started doing what I do here at open mic night at
    Pitzer College, and I had these songs --- I thought they were pretty good
    --- there was funny stuff about them, but it started to become a thing,
    the open mic night, and I was doing pretty good at it, and I sat down one
    night to play and the whole thing was crowded and I heard a girl whisper
    to her friend, 'Oh, this guy's funny.'" --- Amoeba Music, San Francisco,
    August 22, 2006

    Although John has played this live on a number of occasions, he has grown
    increasingly opposed to doing so. Frequently, even if he plays the song,
    he'll ask that people not share that because he doesn't like people
    yelling for it (and conversely, occasionally rewards crowds for not
    requesting it). Explaining this feeling, John writes:

    > I don't play "Golden Boy" because it sort of just doesn't really fit into
    > the set, usually - it feels like, you know, like let's say we're all
    > sitting around sharing stories about times we were in really bad shape,
    > and there's funny parts to the stories but they've also got some real dark
    > depths, we're really having the sort of conversation that makes you feel
    > like conversation is an essential human activity maybe higher than the
    > arts or science or whatever... and then one guy says "Hey, did you guys
    > see that quiz Jane shared on Facebook, 'Which Famous Nihilist or Member of
    > One Direction Are You?'" and everybody's like dude, yes, hilarious, kinda
    > not now, also you're talking about Facebook in conversation.
    > 
    > That's "Golden Boy." "Golden Boy" in the live set is the guy talking about
    > Facebook instead of participating in the conversation. I dig "Golden Boy"
    > on the compilation it was issued on and on the comp-of-comps it was
    > reissued on, but it generally doesn't belong in the live set. I think I
    > last played it in... 2012? Not that long ago. Same basic deal with most of
    > the "funny" songs, for me playing live is trying to build a house in real
    > time. No funny angles on the doors, I want everybody inside the house by
    > the time I'm done so we can all get scared in the dark together.

[^goldenseries]:
    Golden Boy is part of the [Song for ... series](series.html#songfor) and
    the informal [series of Biblical references](series.html#bible).

[^object]:
    Golden Boy was originally released on *Object Lessons: Songs About
    Products*, a compilation released by the magazine [Beer Frame: The Journal
    of Inconspicuous Consumption](http://www.core77.com/inconspicuous/), which
    celebrates and "deconstructs the details of consumer culture", as their
    website explains.

[^goldenboy]:
    As John [explains above](#fn:goldenjohn), Golden Boy Peanuts was an Asian
    brand of canned, braised peanuts. It's unclear to me if they're still
    being manufactured; I've never found any myself, and John claims that
    they're not, but I haven't been able to verify that. If you know more,
    please [let me know](../about.html#contact)!

    Zoop II, Farm Sanctuary, New York, June 14, 2009.

[^lukas]:
    Most likely refers to Paul Lukas, who is thanked in the [liner
    notes](#liner) and who was the editor and publisher of *Beer Frame: The
    Journal of Inconspicuous Consumption*, the magazine which released [Object
    Lessons](#fn:object).

[^goldenrule]:
    From the famous [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule),
    found in almost every culture and stating that one should treat others as
    one wishes to be treated. While this maxim predates Christianity, this
    particular phrasing is strongly associated with the version reported in
    the Bible to have been spoken by Jesus during the Sermon on the Mount:

    > And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.

    This is retold in the other Gospels as well.

    King James Version, retrieved October 31, 2014.

[^jeremiah]:
    A likely reference to one of several Biblical verses, such as Numbers 10:9
    or Jeremiah 15:11. Both verses differ between translations, but in the
    King James Version, [Numbers
    10:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+10:9&version=KJV)
    reads:

    > And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you,
    > then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered
    > before the Lord your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.

    In the less common Modern Spelling Tyndale--Coverdale Bible, but also
    several other translations, Jeremiah 15:11 reads:

    > And the LORD answered me, "Lead not I thee then unto good? Come not I to
    > thee, when thou art in trouble? And help thee, when thine enemy oppresseth
    > thee?

[^eternity]:
    Alternately sung, "So that when you die, you'll spend eternity
    enjoying..." These lines are also often swapped with the final two lines
    in the March of Dimes verse. Amoeba Music, San Francisco, August 22, 2006.

[^strolling]:
    Sometimes sung, "Strolling through the fields, gazing at you from the
    shelves..." Amoeba Music, San Francisco, August 22, 2006.

[^dimes]:
    The [March of Dimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_Dimes) is an
    American nonprofit originally founded in 1938 to fight polio, but which
    now raises money for the health of infants and pregnant women. The name
    originates as a pun on the 1930s news program, The March of Time, and was
    used for an annual event where dimes were requested for donations.
    Eventually, the name of the organization was changed to the March of Dimes
    from its original name, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis.

[^shade]:
    Also sung, "When your shade is munching on that Golden Boy...", or
    variations of, such as "So that when they send your shade all 17 stories

## Going to Port Washington [^portjohn] [^portseries] [^wedding] [^washington] ## {#port}

The trees were all decked out in their best fall colors \\
There was a snap in the air \\
When you eased down the window \\
And the New York sun brought out the highlights in your hair \\
And gently \\
Gently \\
The constellations aligned \\
And as we crossed over the Throgs Neck Bridge [^throgsneck] \\
I had something on my mind

When we rolled down the street \\
In the cool of the morning \\
I could feel the new day dawn \\
And somebody'd gone and turned the waterworks on \\
And slowly \\
Surely \\
I saw the whole story unwind \\
I had never loved anyone like I loved you \\
And I had something on my mind

    "Arguably the best studio recording Rachel and I ever made, this was
    written for the 7" that Dan and Danielle Varenka sent out as a wedding
    invitation. It's backwards-masked message has been modified slightly as to
    extend best wishes to the bride and groom, though it also rather
    dishonorably concludes by asking them if they can't float us a loan to
    cover the costs of repairing the stove, which we ruined when we tried to
    bake a Radio Shack Concertmate in a pastry shell." --- Ghana liner notes

We boarded up the windows \\
And we sealed the door shut \\
And we let the special chicken \\
Build a nest right by the window \\
Your face was glowing \\
The heat was strong \\
We ate cold, black eggs all day long \\
In the winter when the wind kicked up

I saw your body moving \\
Through the incandescent light \\
You were dancing by yourself there \\
Your sweater hugged your shoulders \\
And it was all right \\
We plucked sugar crystals from the cold English air \\
I had a present for you hidden somewhere \\
In the winter when the wind kicked up

[^kirbyjohn]:
    "It was Rik Albatross of West Yorkshire who sent me a postcard bearing the
    title of this song. 'Cleveland,' 'Great Neck,' 'Nikes' --- not that there
    aren't boatloads of great U.S. place names, but Kirby Sigston, man: now
    there's a name that rolls off the tongue nicely. Rik Albatross,
    incidentally, is the kind of fan that narcissistic singer-songwriters
    dream of having, always sending cool postcards from vacations and winning
    back the good name of fanaticism. Rik --- we raise these next three
    brim-full glasses of Polish vodka to you! This song has never been
    released." --- Ghana liner notes

    On one of the [advance cassettes](#fn:heydank), John wrote, "suggested by
    RIK ALBATROSS". Rik has confirmed that his postcards led John to write the
    song (personal correspondence, 2014).

    Given the small size of the town, the song ultimately resulted in a local
    news article, in which locals expressed their confusion about the song:

    > Few people have heard of the tiny North Yorkshire hamlet of Kirby Sigston.
    > Located four miles east of Northallerton and near the busy A19, the
    > scattered nature of the houses and farms often leave visitors confused
    > about where the place begins and ends.
    > 
    > Strange then, that it has been chosen as a song title by a US indie rock
    > band.
    > 
    > The Mountain Goats have named one of their tracks Going to Kirby Sigston.
    > 
    > The song has been played in locations including Amsterdam, Frankfurt and
    > New York and is one of 42 numbers in the band's "Going to..." series.
    > 
    > It is safe to say that Kirby Sigston is the smallest place in the

It was hot but not too hot \\
It was hot but not too hot

    "For a surprising (to me) number of people, this is the best Mountain
    Goats song. I am pretty fond of it myself. I do not wish to disappoint its
    champions by letting the cat out of the bag, but truth will out, as the
    poet has it: played backwards, the recording just says 'Mother Monahan's
    Mohair Chestwig / Mother Monahan's Mohair Chestwig' over and over again.
    Dark and Mysterious are the rulers of the spirit world, I guess. Dark and
    mysterious or just crazy, maybe." --- Ghana liner notes

    "This, to the best of anybody's knowledge, is a true story." --- Letters
    to Santa, Chicago, December 7, 2011

    When asked about the song, John explained:

    > The third verse, if there were one, would not be "and here's what caused
    > his death." It would just be another thing a person might do in his house
    > as he went about his day. The song isn’t about Jimi Hendrix's death; it's
    > essentially a riff on [Musee de Beaux
    > Arts](http://english.emory.edu/classes/paintings&poems/auden.html). When I
    > say "riff" I don't mean that the point is the same, but that it sort of
    > responds to Auden’s observation, maybe continues it, or zags left with it,
    > or takes it inward some.
    > 
    > The song would literally lose whatever power it has if there were a verse
    > about death and its causes, etc, *pace* your dad, much love to dad of
    > course.

    [Musée des Beaux
    Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_des_Beaux_Arts_(poem)) is a
    celebrated poem by W. H. Auden that describes how the world continues on
    in its mundane ways even alongside tremendous suffering:

    > About suffering they were never wrong, \\
    > The old Masters: how well they understood \\
    > Its human position: how it takes place \\
    > While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully
    >     along; \\
    > How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting \\
    > For the miraculous birth, there always must be \\
    > Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating \\
    > On a pond at the edge of the wood: \\
    > They never forgot \\
    > That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course \\
    > Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot \\
    > Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse \\
    > Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.
    > 
    > In Breughel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away \\
    > Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may \\
    > Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry, \\
    > But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone \\
    > As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green \\
    > Water, and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen \\
    > Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky, \\
    > Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.

    Related to the Ghana liner notes above, to the best of my knowledge,
    "Mother Monahan's Mohair Chest Wig" originates in advertisements for
    [Camel cigarettes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_(cigarette)) in the
    1940s.  NBC used to air the Camel Program, a humor show sponsored by Camel
    to sell cigarettes. One script for a humorous Camel Program advertisement
    on April 29, 1943 contains the following text:

    > All of these fine organizations brought to you by the makers of Mother
    > Monahan's Mohair Chest Wigs! Man --- are you ashamed to appear on the

    point that I'm reasonably convinced that it was an intentional homage.

    Centuries later, a singer in California would note that 'Yeah, the Picts!'

    perhaps vainly, that the 'all you'd get/alphabet' rhyme offsets the

[^anglo]:
    The [Anglo-Saxons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons) were the
    people who lived in Great Britain from roughly 450 ACE until the Norman
    Conquest in 1066. As [John says above](#fn:anglojohn), much of this song
    is accurate in generality, although some parts refer to the
    [Picts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts), who inhabited Scotland from
    prior to the Roman conquest of Britain through approximately 1000 ACE,
    rather than the Anglo-Saxons.

    The Picts are believed to have painted and tattooed themselves with
    [woad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isatis_tinctoria), or *Isatis
    tinctoria*, a blue-dying plant native to Scotland, to the point that their
    name in Latin (*Picti*) means *painted*, and the name they called
    themselves is lost to history. Additionally, they did shave their beards,
    but not mustaches, at least as reported by Julius Caesar in his massive
    work, [Commentarii de Bello
    Gallico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentarii_de_Bello_Gallico):

    > Most of the inland inhabitants do not sow corn, but live on milk and
    > flesh, and are clad with skins. All the Britains, indeed, dye themselves
    > with wood, which occasions a bluish color, and thereby have a more
    > terrible appearance in fight. They wear their hair long, and have every
    > part of their body shaved except their head and upper lip.

[^writing]:
    The Picts have been characterized as illiterate, however, several
    historians have begun to challenge that, as their complex art and carvings
    suggested extensive knowledge of the Bible and open the possibility that
    written language may have existed.

    Canterbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Canterbury), a

    founding a school and an abbey. Another Augustine was the famous [St.
    Augustine of Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo), a
    Catholic saint from the 4th and 5th centuries ACE. However, he is not
    known for any literacy or educational campaigns in England or Scotland.
    Thanks to Harrison Lemke for pointing out Saint Augustine of Canterbury to

[^invasion]:
    The [Norman
    conquest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England) was
    the invasion of England by William the Conqueror of Normandy in 1066.
    While successful, he faced English rebellions through the late 11th
    century. This wrested power away from Anglo-Saxons for good, and these
    peoples fled or became peasants.

    As the Norman conquest didn't reach Scotland, the Picts were not similarly
    dethroned by the invasion. However, during the same time period, they
    fully merged with the Gaels, and Picts as a distinct group were lost.

You and me are in a lot of trouble \\
And somebody's gonna burst our bubble \\
Your husband, my wife \\
My marriage, your life

Let's go to Maine out on the East Coast \\
Let's go to Maine right now \\
Let's beat the retreat, let's hop on the plane \\
Let's get out of here, let's go to Maine

Someone knows what's going on \\
Someone knows, and someone's gonna tell \\
Someone's gonna wrap us up in styrofoam and paper \\
And mail us flat rate [^flatrate] right down to Hell

Let's go to Maine out on the East Coast \\
Yeah, let's go to Maine right now \\
Let's beat the retreat, let's hop on the plane \\
Let's get out of here, let's go to Maine

Let's go to Maine out on the East Coast \\
Let's go to Maine right now \\
Let's beat the retreat, let's hop on the plane \\
Let's get out of here, let's go to Maine

[^mainejohn]:
    "I have still never been to Maine. Apparently my attempts to get invited
    by feigning psychosis have been met with either indifference or very muted
    hostility. This is a very early song that was recorded a little later,
    live on the radio; I remember writing it on an acoustic slide guitar, the
    raised strings hurting my fingers while I played. How could I have known
    that, played backwards, the song would spell out the secret formula for
    Coca-Cola? Even all these years after the lawsuit, I am still a little
    bitter about that. To hold me legally culpable for such effects seems less
    than generous, and certainly not in the best interests of justice." ---
    Ghana liner notes

    "When I was writing songs like that, I had never been further east than,
    you know, like, Portland, Oregon, so, or maybe Upland, California... I
    mean, I was born in Indiana, but my family moved out to California when I
    was like a year old, and so when I would think of Maine, and like the
    whole --- just the term, the East Coast, this was like Shangri-La, it was
    some great, distant place where people did strange things and engaged in
    customs that I could not understand." --- Black Cat, Washington, October
    11, 2004

    "But I remember \[writing\] this one, I was like, 'Oh, yeah, that's the
    one that's going to get us all rich.' Then, three weeks later it turned
    out that no, that's one of those songs that you think is funny, and people
    who like Mountain Goats songs think is funny, but everybody else wonders
    what on Earth you're talking about." --- American Theater Company,
    Chicago, May 16, 2010

    "It's kind of a dumb song... It's an excuse to put Maine into the series
    of songs I had been writing." --- Front Porch Festival, Wente Vineyards,
    Livermore, September 1, 2012

## Noctifer Birmingham [^noctiferjohn] [^forward] [^noctifer] [^birmingham]  ## {#noctifer}

I had to stop and catch my breath \\
When the telephone rang out as loud as death \\
It was 3 in the morning \\
There was a low drone of katydids [^katydid] behind your voice \\
And I came down \\
From Harrisburg, Pennsylvania [^harrisburg] \\
And I saw you by the highway

You asked me if the north was all right \\
And I said it got kind of cold at night \\
I could feel your bones shivering \\
Way down there in Birmingham [^birmingham] \\
And I came down \\
From Harrisburg, Pennsylvania \\
And I saw you by the highway

You reminded me of all the things you'd given up forever \\
And you asked about the children and you asked about the weather \\
And then I came down \\
From Harrisburg, Pennsylvania \\
And I saw you by the highway

[^noctiferjohn]:
    "The patient listener is rewarded for slogging through this compilation
    with this, probably the high-water mark of the years 1992 -- 95. In a rare
    show of restraint, I do not even once attempt here to physically destroy
    the guitar by playing it as hard as I can. It was recorded during the
    Super Bowl in 1994. Underused as a fight song during sporting events;
    overused for selling eyeshadow at popular cosmetics counters across the
    country and worldwide. One of my own personal favorites." --- Ghana liner
    notes. See also McCabe's Guitar Shop, Santa Monica, June 30, 2012.

[^forward]:
    Originally released on the *Fast Forward 2* sampler from Brinkman Records.
    On the booklet page for Noctifer Birmingham, the following [Thomas
    Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy) quote was included:

    > You should hae talked like that in former days \\
    > When I was last home.

    The line is from his poem *The Harbour Bridge*.

[^noctifer]:
    In Latin, *noctifer* means *evening-star*, which in English at least
    generally refers to Venus.

[^birmingham]:
    Given the geography of the song, this most likely refers to [Birmingham,
    Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama), a major
    metropolis in the center of the state.

[^katydid]:
    A [katydid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tettigoniidae) is a member of
    Tettigoniidae, a family of insects closely related to grasshoppers and
    crickets. Like these relatives, they make loud mating calls at night by
    rubbing parts of their wings together.

[^harrisburg]:
    [Harrisburg,
    Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania) is
    the capital of Pennsylvania, located in the southeastern portion of the
    state.

## Leaving Home [^leavingjohn] [^cyanide] ## {#leaving}

We gathered up our worldly goods \\
Stole off in the dawn as quickly as we could \\
You were quieting the baby down \\
When we came to the dock on the outskirts of town

And looking back we saw China \\
Shrinking to the size of a coin \\
And then we saw water \\
Everywhere

When we climbed on board \\
They tied our things together with electrical cord \\
And then we set sail \\
As we held on tight to the cold iron rail

And I apologize, but I don't know what I loved more \\
You next to me there or the receding shore \\
We stood there in the cold \\
And the baby was six months old \\
We were passing him back and forth \\
When a cold, familiar wind came down from the north

And looking back we saw China \\
Shrinking to the size of a coin \\
And then we saw water \\
Everywhere

[^leavingjohn]:
    "One of the very few songs I wrote during the six months when I was living
    in Chicago. I missed California. It seems maudlin to say things out loud,
    so I made up a whole different set of circumstances with which to surround
    the feeling. This song, then, is obliquely about watching the California
    coastline fade into memory as an airplane took me from L.A. to O'Hare
    Airport in August of 1995. Quite obliquely, actually, as this song takes
    place in China." --- Ghana liner notes

[^cyanide]:
    Originally released on the *Cyanide Guilt Trip* 7" vinyl compilation from
    Cactus Gum records in 1995.
