[^petroniusjohn]:
    "This was the first single, and it sported an absolutely beautiful sleeve
    by Ian Smith's Juggernaut Press. Its back featured a quotation from Nero
    and another, unattributed from Turnbull's *The Mountain People*. The sound
    of the singing on it makes me cringe, but I am aware of a few people who
    think this is as close to perfection as I've come. These are the same
    people who think that Suede was possibly the greatest band in the world
    when they were just playing in small clubs around London but became the
    worst band in the world as soon as they release their first single. There
    is no known way to satisfy these people without breaking most of the laws
    of time. Anyhow, 'The Bad Doctor' was widely misunderstood and nobody
    seemed to get 'Pure Love.' 'The Lady from Shanghai,' though --- when I
    hear that comparatively young man get all breathy there, I see what he
    means, and I feel like he was onto something." ---Bitter Melon Farm liner

[^petronius]:
    [Petronius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petronius) was a first century AD
    Roman consul and author of the Satyricon, a satirical novel about
    lower-class Roman life and love. Accused of treason due to the jealousy of
    a corrupt Praetorian Guard prefect, he committed suicide in 66 AD.

-- Bera ngag [^greeting]

[^oneneck]:
    A slight misspelling of "Utinam populus Romanus unam cervicem haberet", a
    quotation of Caligula's documented by Suetonius in [The Twelve
    Caesars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Caesars), meaning, "I
    wish the Roman people had but one neck", the implication being that he
    could cut it with a single stroke. The context of the quotation is as
    follows, describing Caligula's cruelty:

    He generally prolonged the sufferings of his victims by causing them to be
    inflicted by slight and frequently repeated strokes; this being his
    well-known and constant order: "Strike so that he may feel himself die."
    Having punished one person for another, by mistaking his name, he said "he
    deserved it quite as much." He had frequently in his mouth these words of
    the tragedian: "Oderint dum metuant." I scorn their hatred, if they do but
    fear me. He would often inveigh against all the senators without
    exception, as clients of Sejanus, and informers against his mother and
    brothers, producing the memorials which he had pretended to burn, and
    excusing the cruelty of Tiberius as necessary, since it was impossible to
    question the veracity of such a number of accusers. He continually
    reproached the whole equestrian order, as devoting themselves to nothing
    but acting on the stage, and fighting as gladiators. Being incensed at the
    people's applauding a party at the Circensian games in opposition to him,
    he exclaimed, "I wish the Roman people had but one neck." When Tetrinius,
    the highwayman, was denounced, he said his persecutors too were all
    Tetrinius's. Five Retiarii, in tunics, fighting in a company, yielded
    without a struggle to the same number of opponents; and being ordered to
    be slain, one of them taking up his lance again, killed all the
    conquerors. This he lamented in a proclamation as a most cruel butchery,
    and cursed all those who had borne the sight of it.

    Suetonius (1889). [*The Lives of the Twelve
    Caesars*](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0132%3Alife%3Dcal.%3Achapter%3D30).

[^caligula]:
    [Caligula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula) was a notoriously brutal
    Roman emperor in the first century AD. After years of self-indulgence,
    murder for pleasure, grotesque sex, potential insanity, wanton
    destruction, and other obscenity, he was assassinated in 41 AD.

[^finkerpearl]:
    Slightly misspelled, [Ellen
    Finkerpearl](http://www.scrippscollege.edu/academics/faculty/ellen-finkelpearl.php)
    is a professor of classics at Scripps, presumably one of John's classics
    professors when he studied at Pitzer.

[^greeting]:
    A bleak purported greeting in Ik, a UNESCO severely endangered language of
    the Ik people in northern Uganda. According to anthropologist Colin
    Turnbull, the greeting begins, "Brinji ngag", meaning, "Bring me food",
    and concludes with the response, "Bera ngag", "There is no food." However,
    Turnbull's study has drawn criticism and may not be an accurate
    representation of Ik society and language, and more thorough investigation
    reveals that Ik greetings are closer to what one would expect.

## The Bad Doctor [^doctorjohn] ## {#doctor}

If you were anywhere near his door \\
You saw it swing open, and you heard the moon roar \\
Trying to yank herself right out of her orbit \\
The whole natural world painted red, just like a target

It was a cold dark day \\
With low clouds standing in the way \\
And the stars jockeying for position \\
On the slow, thick morning of the death-dealing physician \\
Oh yeah \\
Oh yeah \\
Oh yeah \\
Oh yeah

And you could feel his features in the air \\
A wide smile and perfect hair \\
He had complete control of the rising tide \\
And a medicine bag hanging at his side

It was a cold dark day \\
With low clouds standing in the way \\
And the stars jockeying for position \\
In the flowing blue world of the death-dealing physician \\
Oh yeah \\
Oh yeah \\
Oh yeah \\
Oh yeah

And the rain came down like water from a faucet \\
I saw him at the crossroads but I never saw him cross it [^crossroads] \\
One minute he was on this side and the next he was over on the other \\
So went his rounds one sad [^dead] patient after another

It was a cold dark day \\
With low clouds standing in the way \\
And the stars jockeying for position \\
In the crushed velvet world of the death-dealing physician

It was a cold dark day \\
With low clouds standing in the way \\
And the stars jockeying for position \\
In the impossibly large office of the death-dealing physician [^inestimably] \\
Oh yeah \\
Oh yeah \\
Oh yeah \\
Oh yeah

[^doctorjohn]:
    "I stopped playing this song because people thought it was about Jack
    Kevorkian, which it is not. It's about a malevolent force that runs around
    dispensing death in the guise of medicine --- actual widespread death, not
    the merciful death of Jack Kevorkian." --- Swedish-American Hall, San
    Francisco, June 28, 2012

[^crossroads]:
    In many mythologies, [a
    crossroads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossroads_(mythology))
    represents a liminal space where one can interact with the spirit world.
    In Western mythology, the crossroads are a place where one can call the
    Devil into the world to broker a deal for one's soul, such as with the
    story of Robert Johnson.

[^dead]:
    Sometimes sung, "So went his rounds one dead patient after another".
    Swedish-American Hall, San Francisco, June 28, 2012.

[^inestimably]:
    Also, "In the inestimably large office of the death-dealing physician".
    Swedish-American Hall, San Francisco, June 28, 2012.

## Alpha Double Negative: Going to Catalina [^catalinajohn] [^catalinaseries] [^catalina] [^nfj] [^negative] ## {#catalina}

I hear you starting up again \\
I see you standing on the deck \\
I hear your voice start to carry \\
I see the veins throbbing in your neck

And I know what you're saying \\
And I know what you're saying it for \\
But I'm not listening \\
I'm not listening anymore

And I see you come toward me \\
I see the sun climb down the sky \\
I hear your voice getting faster and louder \\
I see a stranger in your eyes

And I know what you're saying \\
And I know what you're saying it for \\
But I'm not listening \\
I'm not listening anymore

[^catalinajohn]:
    John specified that this song is sung from the perspective of the wife in
    the Alpha relationship. Cow Haus, Tallahassee, February 6, 1998.

[^catalinaseries]:
    Alpha Double Negative: Going to Catalina is part of the [Going to ...
    series](series.html#goingto), the [Alpha couple
    series](series.html#alpha), and the [informal series of alternate
    versions](series.html#demos).

[^catalina]:
    There are quite a few places named Catalina, but given John's childhood in
    Southern California and his description of the Alpha Couple as being from
    California (see the [series page](./series.html#alpha)), my best guess is
    that this refers to [Santa Catalina Island][catalinawiki], a popular
    vacation spot off of the coast of Los Angeles.

[catalinawiki]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catalina_Island,_California

[^nfj]:
    Like [Going to Kansas](hound.html#kansas), Alpha Double Negative: Going to
    Catalina was rerecorded for the later album Nothing for Juice. The
    versions are very similar except for a somewhat different sound and some
    minor grammatical changes.

[^negative]:
    It's unclear to me if there's any relationship between this song and
    [Alpha Negative](hound.html#negative). If you know something, please [fill
    me in](../about.html#contact)!

## Pure Intentions [^intentionsseries] ## {#intentions}

You're a strong one \\
You're a lion \\
You're brave \\
And death-defying \\
You're in your car \\
Crossing town \\
And I can feel you \\
Coming down

You're so pretty \\
I could burst \\
And I wonder \\
Who's gonna talk first \\
My muscles all shaking \\
My blood's turned to foam \\
It's Tuesday \\
And you're coming home \\
Yeah

## The Lady from Shanghai [^welles] ## {#shanghai}

The waves were beating \\
Against the shore \\
The waves were beating \\
As if they hadn't before \\
The dock was soaking \\
The wood was wet \\
Your hair blew madly \\
I can't forget \\
We went down to the boat \\
We went down to the boat \\
We went down to the boat \\
We went down to the boat \\
Yeah

The rushing water \\
The pale sky \\
Hey, that's a good way \\
To let the deck dry \\
You know what I mean \\
We were slaves \\
The world was lurching \\
The dark ways \\
We went down to the boat \\
We went down to the boat \\
We went down to the boat \\
We went down to the boat \\
Yeah

[^welles]:
    [The Lady from
    Shanghai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady_from_Shanghai) is a 1947
    Orson Welles noir film about a sailor who, after becoming interested in a
    married woman, becomes caught in a plot to frame him for a murder. This
    could describe a number of scenes in the film, however, my best guess is
    that this explores the tension between Michael O'Hara, the framed sailor,
    and Elsa, his married love interest.

## Pure Love [^pureloveseries] ## {#purelove}

Hey, what's wrong with you \\
Hey, what are you trying to do \\
Because if what you have in mind \\
Is what I think it is, then it's not very kind \\
It won't be necessary \\
It won't be necessary now \\
It won't be necessary \\
It won't be necessary now

Hey, what are you doing, my love \\
Hey, didn't I just tell you that such a thing would be over and above \\
What's called for in this case \\
Pull the ski mask away from your face \\
It won't be necessary \\
It won't be necessary now \\
It won't be necessary \\
It won't be necessary now \\
It won't be necessary \\
It won't be necessary now

    Pure Love is part of the [Pure ... series](series.html#pure).
