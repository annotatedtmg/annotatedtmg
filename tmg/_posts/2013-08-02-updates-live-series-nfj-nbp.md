Hello! To [the live show directory](https://annotatedtmg.org/live.html),
I have added Wits, a live show from 2011 on Minnesota Public Radio
featuring a dobro version of Rotten Stinking Mouthpiece and a cover of
Crazy Train, among other things. Within [Nine Black
Poppies](https://annotatedtmg.org/nbp.html), Chanson du Bon Chose was
updated, and I added the full liner notes to [Nothing for
Juice](https://annotatedtmg.org/nfj.html). Additionally, I've made some
minor additions to the [series](https://annotatedtmg.org/series.html)
page.
