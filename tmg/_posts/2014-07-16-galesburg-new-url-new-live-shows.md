Lots of good news today!

First, I'm delighted to have finished annotating Full Force Galesburg, a
favorite album with lots of good annotations (although not as many as I'd
wish). I learned a lot, hopefully you will too.

Second, I've registered a new URL for this site so that I can take it
eventually off of my personal server:
[annotatedtmg.org](http://annotatedtmg.org). I think this'll be easier to
remember and make the site a little more official; for now, that link
redirects to my website still, but I'm planning on moving all of the
material to a dedicated space when I have time.

Third, several new shows are up: Kresge Recital Hall in Galesburg
(appropriately), Fitzgerald's in Houston, and a cover from Boys Rock for
Girls Rock. I've also added some songs I've discovered (thanks, Martin!)
to the song list, namely the Spellbound cover, Wishing the House Would
Crash, and Hello Sarah.

Finally, annotations have been added to the online release page for the
new [Who You Are](http://annotatedtmg.org/online.html#who) cover, released
very recently on Google Play for Merge 25.

Thanks for reading!
