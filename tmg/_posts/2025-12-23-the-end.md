title: 	"The end of the Annotated Mountain Goats"
---

With an open and loving heart, it is time to say goodbye.

I once upon a time wrote and edited this site obsessively. I have been
surprised and very touched by the ongoing interest and love for this project
and so [recently
shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/themountaingoats/comments/1pu3whj/website_hosting_ending_for_the_annotated_mountain/):
the web hosting for tAMG is going away in the near future. The project will
therefore end sometime in the coming months. [Riley
Routh](https://rileyrouth.com), a contributor, has kindly offered to take over
the URLS and continue hosting the site in the immediate future. That said, if
someone would like to host a mirror themselves, they are welcome to do so. The
URLs ([annotatedtmg.org](https://annotatedtmg.org) and
[annotatedtmg.com](https://annotatedtmg.com)) may eventually lapse.

The source code of tAMG is hosted on GitHub. I have no plans to remove it. You
can download and build the website on your computer using the instructions
there. There are also instructions on how to download a local copy of the
website [here](./contact.html#download). If the website has some importance to
you I recommend doing both of these in case GitHub chooses to stop hosting the
source data.

Thank you for all the love, music, and good times. I truly enjoyed it. This
project meant a great deal to me and I put a lot of my heart into it. It is
strange, silly, overly intense, overly literal, and very me --- at least a
very young me. I feel very grateful for all the kindness and connection I
experienced with many of you because of this obsession and our shared love of
this music. I am honored to now become ephemera, like much of John's beautiful
creations themselves.
