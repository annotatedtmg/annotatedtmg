Thanks to all of you who've written to me in the last couple of months,
and thanks for your thoughts and corrections, as well as to folks on the

updates and corrections have been added, including:

* A correction to the citronella line in [Cao Dai
  Blowout](http://annotatedtmg.org/cinema.html#caodai)
* Biblical allusions in
  [Magpie](http://annotatedtmg.org/sunset.html#magpie), [Psalms
  40:2](http://annotatedtmg.org/tlotwtc.html#psalms), [Night of the
  Mules](http://annotatedtmg.org/chile.html#mules), [Against
  Pollution](http://annotatedtmg.org/wsabh.html#pollution), and [New World
  Emerging Blues](http://annotatedtmg.org/australia.html#newworld)
* The identity of the John Davis in [Song for John
Davis](http://annotatedtmg.org/fire.html#johndavis)

  [FM](http://annotatedtmg.org/sweden.html#fm) lyrics
* Sources to [From TG&Y](http://annotatedtmg.org/online.html#fromtgny)
  (unknowingly omitted in XHTML through a syntax error)
* John's commentary on [Marduk T-Shirt Men's Room
  Incident](http://annotatedtmg.org/heretic.html#marduk) (which I'd had lying
  around but hadn't gotten around to transcribing)
* A number of small corrections

Catch you on the next update! Please [write
