I finished annotating the lion's share of [The Coroner's
Gambit](https://annotatedtmg.org/coroner.html), and it's now up for
perusal. It's the largest annotation to date, with 71 footnotes at
present, and I'm looking forward to adding to it as I find more material.

Several other additions have been made, most significantly adding
Keith-Albee Theatre, Huntington, West Virginia, 2012-11-04; Newport Folk
Festival - Fort Adams State Park, Rhode Island, 2013-07-26; NPR interview,
2013-08-10; and SPIN interview, 2013-08-13 to the [live show
database](https://annotatedtmg.org/live.html). I've also made some minor
updates and corrections to assorted pages, thanks to everyone who's caught
those.
