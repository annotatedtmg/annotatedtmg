I love everything about this delightful EP: its origin, the details about
its pressings, releases at live shows, being a true EP in every sense, and
the tremendously beautiful and fascinating songs on it. Surprisingly good
material exists explaining some of these songs, and I hope you enjoy them
as much as I did.
