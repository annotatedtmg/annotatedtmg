This is the most awesome annotation yet, I'm convinced. I've never found
any translations of the Japanese On Juhu Beach liner notes anywhere, but
here they are --- along with John's other commentary, explanations of a
few obscure items (such as Kalpadruma trees and the Transjordanian Blues
references), and typical annotations. Translated, there's some fantastic
stuff in the liner notes --- particularly, modifications to the lyrics and
short explanations to each song on the album. Exciting!

John's translator of the liner notes into Japanese has an amazing band
that I really recommend: Jamaican Cheek. (That's what those words in
English are doing on the album!) They're really special, I [recommend
giving them a listen](https://soundcloud.com/jamaican-cheek/), especially
if you like postrock.
