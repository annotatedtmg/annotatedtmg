After a ton of work --- and thanks enormously to the again truly fantastic
contributions of [echo](http://patricklickman.com/), Tallahassee is up.
Along with it is a greatly updated summary of the [Alpha
series](https://annotatedtmg.org/series.html#alpha) and a nearly
complete [text mirror of the
microsite](https://annotatedtmg.org/mirror/tallahassee-microsite.txt).
I'm stoked to add Tallahassee --- as one of the releases with an enormous
amount of material behind it it feels good to have tackled it.

I've also begun to add to the [covers
list](https://annotatedtmg.org/series.html#covers), which was a real
pleasure, now listing a few dozen songs that the Mountain Goats have
played.

Hope you enjoy the updates!
