I am delighted to announce that Yam, the King of Crops, is now annotated.
This was a tremendous amount of fun and there are a lot of good references
to African literature to be discovered therein. I'm also pleased to have
found several references related to the above songs, which you can find in
the pages for Sweden, the Coroner's Gambit, and the Life of the World to
Come.

On the live show front, another KUCI session has been unearthed, and there
is some information about recent shows in Manchester and Amsterdam.
