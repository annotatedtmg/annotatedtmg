I thought I'd quickly upload this lovely, short split EP. There's not much to
say about it --- except that in the absence of evidence, I've come down on the
side of those who don't think this is an Alpha couple song (or at least who
think we can't safely conclude that without some more information from John)
--- but nonetheless I'm delighted to have the lyrics to this wonderful song
up.
