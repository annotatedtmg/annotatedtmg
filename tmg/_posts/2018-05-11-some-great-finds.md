title: 	Jack & Faye; Hail and Farewell, Gothenburg; great finds; some new live shows
---

Hello friends!

[Jack & Faye](https://annotatedtmg.org/jackfaye.html), an amazing EP, and
[Hail and Farewell, Gothenburg](https://annotatedtmg.org/hafg.html) have both
been added! Hail and Farewell, Gothenburg was a complex annotation to add, and
I'd appreciate anyone planning to use it considering reading some brief
thoughts on it that I wrote [on the page
itself](https://annotatedtmg.org/hafg.html#fn:caveat). I think the summary is
that John is sensitive about the album, but it's an open secret at this point,
acknowledged by Nall for many years. There's a line somewhere and I don't
think this is crossing it, but please don't be a dick about it (to him, I
mean, not me).

There's also been a number of amazing finds by people that I've updated over
the last six months or so:

* Several thoughts on [Elijah] --- thanks to Mairead Beeson
* Exposures in [Your Belgian Things][belgian] --- thanks to AKM Adam
* MIDI of the [Tyrolese Evening Hymn][hymn] --- thanks to Caliclimber
* Leigh Hunt in [Jenny] --- thanks to Mairead Beeson
* Dylan Thomas in [Alpha Rats Nest] --- thanks to Mairead Beeson
* Hawaii Five-O as the source for the talking in [Going to Alaska] ---
  unbelievable thanks to Ben Franklin
* *Trouble in Mind* in [Song for the Julian Calendar] --- thanks to Evan Perez
* Several references in [Against Pollution] --- thanks to Mairead Beeson

I've added a few new songs to the
[songlist](https://annotatedtmg.org/songlist.html): the Marsh Witch Visions
tracks, Get High and Listen to the Cure, and From the Lake Trials. (If you'd
like to transcribe the Marsh Witch Visions lyrics, definitely [send me an
email!](https://annotatedtmg.org/about.html))

There's been a lot of other technical changes, although you might not be able
to see them on the front end. I've redone the mobile CSS to hopefully make it
much easier to read, and updated the image handling as well. Most notably,
I've converted the entire website to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which was
a lot of work but considerably eases the maintainability of the site, and
moved the server to that of my friend, which also made a lot of things easier
(along with adding HTTPS and making the <https://annotatedtmg.org> URL a fixed
URL). I'm hoping to over time turn some of the site over to a database I've
been slowly working on and a few other things to reduce errors, but those will
take time.

As always, more to come --- thanks for reading!
