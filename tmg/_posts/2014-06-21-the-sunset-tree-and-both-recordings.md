I am so excited to finally host [The Sunset
Tree](https://annotatedtmg.org/sunset.html). Amazing songs, amazing
lyrics, tons of interesting banter. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as
I enjoyed making it.

Over the last weekend, the Mountain Goats played three amazing shows at
the Bottom of the Hill in San Francisco. They were pretty incredible,
being wonderful shows in general and including the entirety of Taking the
Dative, Transmissions to Horace, and Taboo VI inside of them. I taped them
and uploaded them to archive.org; if you want to hear them, see the links
on the [live show page](https://annotatedtmg.org/live.html). Tapes for
The Mayan in Los Angeles and the Crescent Ballroom in Phoenix are also
available.

Until next time!
