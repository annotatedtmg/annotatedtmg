The Ames show will likely be up on archive.org soon and is available on a
lot of the tMG messageboards; if you'd like a copy feel free to reach out
(although a cut up version will likely be uploaded to an easy-to-find
place soon, and I'll post a link to that as soon as I have it). I'll be
adding links to this tour's shows once they're up!

I've also added new links to the soundboard recordings of:

* Bottom of the Hill, San Francisco - 2014-06-14
* Bottom of the Hill, San Francisco - 2014-06-15
* Fillmore, San Francisco - 2015-06-01
* Great American Music Hall, San Francisco - 2015-06-02

In non-tour news, I've corrected the lyrics in Maize Stalk Drinking
Blood to read "shinnied" rather than "shimmied" --- see [Full Force
Galesburg](galesburg.html#maize) for the citation. Additionally, a kind
reader was able to point out that the show previously listed as *Unknown
venue, Columbus, 1994* was actually performed at Stache's. Thank you!

See you soon!
