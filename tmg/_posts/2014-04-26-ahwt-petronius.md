Well, I can't really believe it, but All Hail West Texas is done, or at
least, done for now. This is the album that got me into the Mountain
Goats, so I've been terrified to annotate it, and it's been frustrating
and exciting: frustrating that there isn't more clarity about some songs,
exciting to discover really great annotations and to revisit the album in
depth, especially its fantastic liner notes. This is the longest page to
date, with over 100 footnotes, ranging from in-depth pieces of commentary
by John to minor explanations of locations and businesses. I expect to be
continuing to improve on it for some time; for now, I hope it serves as a
valuable portal to the album.

I've also completed [Songs for
Petronius](https://annotatedtmg.org/petronius.html), mostly because I
really, really, really love the Bad Doctor. It's a short, awesome EP, with
great if short liner notes that were really fun to explore. I hope you
enjoy it too.

To my embarrassment, I had failed to realize that Linda Blair Was Born
Innocent refers to Born Innocent, an almost exploitation film starring
Linda Blair. I've added a footnote about that to [We Shall All Be
Healed](https://annotatedtmg.org/wsabh.html); I hope that's novel
information to some of you.

Until the next time!
