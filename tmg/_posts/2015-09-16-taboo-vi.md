It's been almost a year, but I've finally annotated the first tape: Taboo
VI: The Homecoming. There was much more material than I was expecting ---
some really fun information came out while I was researching it. Hope you
enjoy it!

Briefly, I've also just stumbled across a show from 2006 at Easy Street
Records in Seattle. Download link is on the [live show
page](http://annotatedtmg.org/live.html)!
