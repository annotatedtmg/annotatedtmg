title:  Interview and live show updates!

It's been a while since the last update, but there's been lots of
interviews coming out in the wake of John's release of the excellent and
now somewhat incredibly award-winning bestseller Wolf in White Van. Crazy
to see so many people reading this book, it's awesome. We're now current
to the best of my knowledge on the live recording page; updates include
interviews with Fresh Air, Monsters of Talk, Weekend Edition, Bullseye,
the Los Angeles Review of Books, Kreative Kontrol, and Soundcheck WNYC.
([Contact me](https://annotatedtmg.org/about.html#contact) if you know of
others that I've missed!) There are also a couple of old live shows that
we've found, notably at the Gargoyle in 2012, a cover at Fitzgerald's in
2014, some old Ships and Dip V recordings (including with Propagandhi and
Weakerthans member John K. Samson), and the Merge 25 set at Cat's Cradle.
Thanks to all the tapers that made these possible.

Looking forward to hosting some more annotations soon, but for now, hope
you enjoy these!
