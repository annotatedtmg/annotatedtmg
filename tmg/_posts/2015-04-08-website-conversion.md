As of today, this entire website has been converted to HTML 5! I've tested
the things I thought might break, and everything seemed to look OK, but
please [email me](https://annotatedtmg.org/about.html#contact) if you see
something wrong.

To my utter shock, the Annotated Mountain Goats were mentioned in [a
recent article on the Mountain Goats by Daniel Ries, In Praise of the
Digital-Era Obscurity of the Mountain
Goats](http://killscreendaily.com/articles/praise-digital-era-obscurity-mountain-goats/).
It blows me away that people outside of our small fan community are
reading this to whatever small degree. Entirely aside from that, it's an
interesting article, so check it out.
