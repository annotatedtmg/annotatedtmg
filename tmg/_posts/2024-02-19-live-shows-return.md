I am absolutely delighted to have reuploaded all my old live tapes. Some of
these are just absolutely precious to me, and include my favorite recordings
of all time. In particular, the legendary Bottom of the Hill shows from 2014
are a deep favorite. John and Peter playing Tulsa Imperative on the first
night, and all of us singing along to California Song on the last night, are
some cherished memories.

A few other favorite moments: the amazing versions of The Bad Doctor and
Shadow Song at the Swedish-American Hall, unexpectedly lucking into hearing
Sign of the Crow 2 with a tiny crowd at Laurie's Planet of Sound while waiting
for the show that night, passing out buttons and meeting new friends in the
line and front row of the Great American Music Hall, road tripping across the
southwest for the 2014 tour. There are soundboard recordings of some of these,
as you can see on the [live show directory](live.html), but I love the sound
of the crowd. I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.

There's a small chance that I'm misremembering taping one of these --- I
didn't keep any record other than the tapes themselves, and the old forums
where I posted them are long gone. That said, I'm confident enough to have
uploaded them and believe these to all be mine. If I've made a mistake, please
[email me](about.html#contact) so I can fix it.

So, so, so happy to have these out for everyone to hear!
