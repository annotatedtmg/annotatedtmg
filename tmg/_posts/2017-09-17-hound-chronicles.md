I've been wanting to post this for a while, but it's finally done: [The
Hound Chronicles](http://annotatedtmg.org/hound.html), in all its glory.
Hope you enjoy!

I've updated the [song list](http://annotatedtmg.org/songlist.html) and
[series](http://annotatedtmg.org/series.html) pages substantially,
separating out the alternate versions and demos, adding a section for
collaborations and guest appearances, separating live-only covers, and
creating a new section for material released as the Extra Glenns or Extra
Lens.

Lyrics are now up for:

* [Hot Garden Stomp](http://annotatedtmg.org/stomp.html)
* [Come, Come to the Sunset Tree](http://annotatedtmg.org/ccst.html)
* [Selected Goths in Ambient](http://annotatedtmg.org/ambient.html)

Thanks to Wil Hall for his help with Come, Come to the Sunset Tree!
