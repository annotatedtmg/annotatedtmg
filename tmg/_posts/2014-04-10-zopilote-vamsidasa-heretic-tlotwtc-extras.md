Up today: Zopilote Machine, another great album. Unfortunately, I wasn't
able to find a tremendous amount of commentary on some songs, but the
presence of Grendel's Mother, Going to Georgia, the Nahuatl songs, and
some other fun annotations made it a real joy.

Additionally, I've adopted a new standard, which is to include information
about outtakes, demos, and so on on each page, and to annotate bonus
tracks with each album. Accordingly, information about Songs for Vamsidasa
Babaji [is now available on the Heretic Pride
page](https://annotatedtmg.org/heretic.html), along with the extras
Toolshed and Last Man on Earth. Similarly, Enoch 18:14 and Proverbs 6:27
are annotated with [The Life of the World to
Come](https://annotatedtmg.org/tlotwtc.html). More information has also
been added throughout TLOTWTC, and related material sections are also on
the Coroner's Gambit, Devil in the Shortwave, Sweden, and Nothing for
Juice, although that information was already available on the [outtakes
and extras list](series.html#outtakes).

If you haven't heard of the Yamaraja Racers, see the information in
Zopilote Machine and added to Nine Black Poppies. Please send any comments
you have, always love hearing from you.
