Taking the Dative is up! I hope you enjoy it. Most exciting to me are the
implications from this album about the [Alpha
couple](http://annotatedtmg.org/dative.html), which are described there,
and the Alpha Gelida annotations.

You may or may not have heard that two unreleased songs, The Ballad of
Bull Ramos and Choked Out, were played at the Merge 25 show. These were
recorded and links are available on the [live show
page](http://annotatedtmg.org/live.html). Enjoy! They're good, as always.
