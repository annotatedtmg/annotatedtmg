[Moon Colony Bloodbath](https://annotatedtmg.org/mcb.html) is one of my
favorite EPs. I've learned a ton about the record in this process, from
Kenneth Anger films to monkey astronauts, and I think there'll be
something in here that's novel for most fans. Hope you enjoy this, again,
as much as I did.

[Songs for Peter Hughes](https://annotatedtmg.org/peter.html) is another
awesome, older EP. There's far less information about it than I could find
for Moon Colony Bloodbath, but there's still some enjoyable material
especially about Song for Dana Plato, but also the stories about the Sign
that most fans reading this site are probably already well acquainted
with. Please enjoy, etc.

Finally, I'm delighted to say that translating the Latin in [Zopilote
Machine](https://annotatedtmg.org/zopilote.html) was really rewarding,
resuling in accurate translations and new connections to two places,
*Asinaria* and *Iphigenia in Tauris*. I hope those annotations are are
interesting and unexpected to you as they were to me.

More soon to come!
