Prompted by a conversation about special shoes on the forums, Chile de
Árbol is up! Short and sweet before the soon-to-be-complete All Hail West
Texas. Hope you enjoy it --- there's very limited information about this
record, but it's still good.

Several new live shows are available: a 2014 AV Club session, a tape of
the Somerville show, and my three tapes of recent shows in Chicago,
including some really excellent new material. Hope you enjoy those as
well.
