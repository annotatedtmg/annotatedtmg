I'm excited to announce this update --- while I don't have another album
annotated (presently working on Philyra, which will be done soon), I've
added a lot to several old pages. John's commentary on Ezekiel 7 and the
Permanent Efficacy of Grace, 1 Samuel 15:23, some extra thoughts on
Matthew 25:21 and Deuteronomy 2:10, and some more have been added. Some
extra commentary on Commandante and the "bi-fi" clip in Nine Black Poppies
are now present. Go check it out.

Regarding live shows, you can now find the BBC Radio Bristol and FSG
sessions alongside the recent Union Chapel show. Additionally, the index
has been updated to reflect the recent discovery of the Transmissions to
Horace extras --- footnotes to eventually follow.

Enjoy!
