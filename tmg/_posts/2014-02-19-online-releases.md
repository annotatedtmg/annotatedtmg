[online](https://annotatedtmg.org/australia.html)
[release](https://annotatedtmg.org/mike.html) that the Mountain Goats
have made and [comprehensively catalogued the outtakes, extras, and
demos](https://annotatedtmg.org/series.html#extra). These were a real
delight to make; I hope you enjoy them.

A number of other updates have been made, including a more logical and
more accurate index, adding references to Philyra and the Coroner's
Gambit, and adding the Opalis, live Transmissions to Horace accidental
tape additions, Old Ideas with New Friends, Weekend America, People's
Place, and St George's shows to the [live show
index](https://annotatedtmg.org/live.html), among other additions and
corrections.

Coming soon: Heretic Pride outtakes (including the Songs for Vamsidasa
Babaji demos) and Tallahassee.
