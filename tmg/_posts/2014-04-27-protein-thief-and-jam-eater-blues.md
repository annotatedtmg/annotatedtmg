I've finally annotated the song that I was most excited about annotating
at the very beginning: Hand Ball. In the process, I've annotated Protein
Source of the Future... NOW! and all of the albums it compiles, including
finally [Why You All So Thief?](https://annotatedtmg.org/thief.html).
I've also annotated [Jam Eater
Blues](https://annotatedtmg.org/jam.html), the Sub Pop Singles Club
release.

All of these were really fun and contain at least a few exceptional
tracks. A few particularly interesting findings are discovering a Sweden
outtake, the source of the title of Why You All So Thief?, the awesome
Protein Source liner notes, and of course, a partial explanation of Hand
Ball.
