Such a wonderful compilation. Not tons to say about it except for Song for
an Old Friend is one of my favorite Mountain Goats tracks of all time.
Going through John's notes in the compilation liner notes is always a
pleasure, and I was able to add some that I'd missed into [Songs for
Petronius](http://annotatedtmg.org/petronius.html) as well. See you next
time!
