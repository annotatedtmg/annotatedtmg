I'm really pleased to upload Transmissions to Horace as what's likely to be my
last upload for a while. After this, updates will continue to come, but likely
at a much slower pace.

A few more updates: I've included some new commentary on the Alpha couple
in the series page (including children and their Nevada hotel days), and
after a conversation with AKM Adam, the theologian who's written on the
Mountain Goats, some notes on Corinthians with reference to Against
Pollution and New World Emerging Blues. Also thanks to Joel Fell for
pointing out some issues related to the Colt .45 in Going to Georgia, the
Notorious B.I.G. reference in Fall of the Star High School Running Back,
and correcting my Going to Queens lyrics --- see those annotations for
more details.

Can't wait to have more annotations up when I can! See you then.
