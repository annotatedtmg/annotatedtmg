Only a year and change overdue, finally --- All Eternals Deck is up. I am
incredibly happy to finally post this. I love AED tremendously, and both
the extras (*Brisbane Hotel Sutra* and *Used to Haunt*) are truly
fantastic. It seems that each release is longer and longer, and at 111
footnotes, this is one of the longest annotations to date.

Many, many thanks to Thomas Fidler, who started these annotations and did
an amazing job at it, and to Andrew Fazzari, who transcribed the Japanese
liner notes. There's clearly stuff written in the Japanese liner notes
that aren't in the English liner notes (see [the footnote for
details](http://annotatedtmg.org/aed.html#fn:japanese)), but I haven't
found anyone to translate it. If you can help, please [let me
know](https://annotatedtmg.org/about.html#contact)!

What's next? I'm not quite sure. *Get Lonely* is a good candidate, but
*The Hound Chronicles* and *Hot Garden Stomp* are calling my name... We'll
have to see. Until then --- stay in touch, and see you at the shows!
