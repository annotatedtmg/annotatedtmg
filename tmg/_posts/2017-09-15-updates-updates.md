Many things to update! Lots is up now that's new from before. Here're all
the new changes:

[Wil Hall](http://wilhall.com/) has awesomely transcribed several albums
worth of lyrics, so while there aren't annotations yet, there are lyrics
for many releases that weren't there before:

* [Get Lonely](http://annotatedtmg.org/lonely.html)
* [Trancendental Youth](http://annotatedtmg.org/youth.html)
* [Beat the Champ](http://annotatedtmg.org/champ.html)
* [Goths](http://annotatedtmg.org/goths.html)
* [The Life of the World in Flux](http://annotatedtmg.org/flux.html)
* [Steal Smoked Fish b/w In the Shadow of the Western
    Hills](http://annotatedtmg.org/steal.html)
* [Blood Capsules b/w Dub Capsules](http://annotatedtmg.org/capsules.html)

I've also uploaded the Japanese liner notes for [Get
Lonely](http://annotatedtmg.org/mirror/gl-japanese-liner.html) thanks to
the stellar work of [Andrew Fazzari](http://www.andrewfazzari.com/) who
transcribed and translated it. The liners for [On Juhu
Beach](http://annotatedtmg.org/mirror/juhu-liner.html) and [All Eternals
Deck](http://annotatedtmg.org/mirror/aed-japanese-liner.html) as well as
both the
[Tallahassee](http://annotatedtmg.org/mirror/tallahassee-microsite.html)
and [We Shall All Be Healed
microsites](http://annotatedtmg.org/mirror/wsabh-microsite.html) are
updated from plain text to much more readable HTML. If you can read and
write Japanese and would like to help translate the AED liner notes,
please get in touch!

The [online releases](http://annotatedtmg.org/online.html) have been
updated to include [For the Krishnacore
Bands](http://annotatedtmg.org/online.html#krishnacore), and the
[songlist](http://annotatedtmg.org/songlist.html) has the following songs
added:

* \[We Do It Different on the West Coast\]
* Moth and Worm
* Etruscans
* Elsa from Rialto
* For the Krishnacore Bands

The [series](http://annotatedtmg.org/series.html) have also been updated
to include the newly-found Emerging demo. (If you know anything about this
and where it's from, please [get in
touch](https://annotatedtmg.org/about.html#contact.html) as I'd love to
know.) Mairead Beeson also pointed out an excellent nod to Blake in
[Philippians 3:20 -- 21](http://annotatedtmg.org/tlotwtc.html#fn:blake)
--- thanks much for sending that in!
