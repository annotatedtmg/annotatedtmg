It seems like it's impossible, but I've finished the last three singles:
[Dilaudid](https://annotatedtmg.org/dilaudid.html), [Letter from
Belgium](https://annotatedtmg.org/belgium.html), and [Palmcorder
Yajna](https://annotatedtmg.org/yajna.html). I love these singles ---
they contain several of my favorite songs (Attention All Pickpockets and
Nova Scotia among them) and while there isn't a ton of material to
annotate them, there's enough that I learned some things and hopefully you
will to. On to more albums!

A few other updates: John's description of the Alpha couple as being
Catholic and a clarification regarding [Third Snow
Song](https://annotatedtmg.org/philyra.html#third).
