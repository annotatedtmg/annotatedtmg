Against all odds, [Get Lonely](https://annotatedtmg.org/lonely.html) is
annotated and up! I owe Bryce Carr and Mairead Beeson huge thanks for helping
with this one: they transcribed and started over half of all the annotations
that ultimately made up this page, and waited extremely patiently as I took
the better part of a year to take the time to work on and upload their
efforts. To both of you: thank you, so, so much, you've done an amazing job
and this would not have happened for years without you.

Thanks also to Wil Hall for doing the original transcription, Andrew Fazzari
for translating and transcribing the Japanese liner notes, and of course,
Caliclimber for not just the cover art but also scans of the Japanese import.

I hope you enjoy it --- there's some lovely allusions in this one. As always,
please [reach out](https://annotatedtmg.org/contact.html) if you discover
more! There's lots I still don't understand and hope to someday.
