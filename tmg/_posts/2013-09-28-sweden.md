[Sweden](https://annotatedtmg.org/sweden.html) goes up today. There's
quite a few open mysteries regarding this album, but thanks to Caliclimber
we're hosting some of the liner notes for, to the best of my knowledge,
the first time online. Hope to keep working on this as I find more
material and that it helps your understanding of the album.

In the background, I've added Terrastock II, the FSG session, and Point
Ephémère, Paris to the [live show
page](https://annotatedtmg.org/live.html) and updated the [Biblical
references](https://annotatedtmg.org/series.html#bible) for Jaipur.
