Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to annotate any new albums (although
I'd like to this summer when I have some time free, if I can), but in the
wake of a new album and the beginning of a new tour, I wanted to update
the bootleg show list. Many shows have surfaced, among them:

* AV Club, 2015
* Double J interview, 2015
* Home Dunk interview, 2015
* Jinx, 2015
* Mercy Lounge, 2015
* NPR, 2015
* Rango's, 2014
* Sketchfest, 2015
* Welcome to Night Vale live, 2015

Download links are available for all of those on the live show page. A
number of older shows have also come up:

* Brownie's, 1997
* Columbus, 1999
* Fletcher's, 1996
* Gothenburg Radio, 1996
* M-Shop, 2003
* M-Shop, 2004
* Showbox, 2009
* Substanz, 2003
* Tokyo Rose, 1996
* Underground, 1995
* Wag Club, 1996
* Zoot's, 1997

If you'd like to trade, let me know!

A few small updates as well --- the Beat the Champ tracks have been added
to the [song list](http://annotatedtmg.org/songlist.html) as have Good
Morning to All Vultures and Just What I Needed; the Who You Are 12" has
been added to the notes about [Who You
Are](https://annotatedtmg.org/online.html#fn:whojohn); and
alternate lyrics to [Orange Ball of
Peace](https://annotatedtmg.org/dative.html#fn:cop) have also been
added.

Until next time, enjoy the new album and the tour!
