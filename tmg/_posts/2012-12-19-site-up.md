title: 	The Annotated Mountain Goats is born

Welcome!

When exactly I first started this website is lost to time, but my best guess
is late 2012 to early 2013. Unfortunately, I didn't log changes until I
started an RSS feed in 2013, so updates until then have been lost to time. I'm
writing this retrospectively in January 2018 --- it's incredible to me how
much this site has grown in those few years.
