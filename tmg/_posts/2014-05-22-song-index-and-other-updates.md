An update between updates: I've added a [song
index](https://annotatedtmg.org/songlist.html), making it easier to find
songs when you can't remember the album and to make it easier to keep up
with rare material. While as of now it only contains material from the
Mountain Goats, the Extra Glenns, and the Extra Lens (and not Seneca
Twins, Bloody Hawaiians, the Congress, and so on), I believe that this is
the most complete song list presently available, so I hope you find it
useful.

A few updates before I upload new albums and singles:

* [Tollund Man](https://annotatedtmg.org/sweden.html#tollund) now has a
much more complete extra lyrics footnote, the contents of which I found
really awesome
* [Downtown Seoul](https://annotatedtmg.org/sweden.html#seoul) earned
some commentary about John Bradford thanks to an email from a fellow fan
* [Tallahassee](https://annotatedtmg.org/tallahassee.html#tallahassee)
has some more information about the ghost voice
* The Tiny Desk Concert has been added to the [live show
directory](https://annotatedtmg.org/live.html)
