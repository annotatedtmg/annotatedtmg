I've annotated the last remaining EPs, [Songs About
Fire](https://annotatedtmg.org/fire.html) and [New Asian
Cinema](https://annotatedtmg.org/cinema.html), alongside the [Tropical
Depression](https://annotatedtmg.org/tropical.html) split! A few
highlights: the annotations to Narakaloka, the Popol Vuh liner notes, and
John's recanting of Anti Music Song. New Asian Cinema has become a beloved
EP for me; I'm surprised I haven't listened to it more and am glad that I
do now.

Soon to come: the last singles!
