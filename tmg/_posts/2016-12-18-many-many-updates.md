title:  Many, many updates
---

My god, it's been a while. I know I promised AED some time ago, and it's
coming, but it's not quite done yet. I'm working on it, if slower than before.

Lots and lots and lots of updates today. In addition to correcting some
typos, here's some of the important additions:

* Added story about Garden Grove to WSABH
* Started a 'Black Sabbath songs' series
* Added California Jam, Wizard Level, and Going Back to California to the
  songlist
* New button!
* Added the Van Morrison reference in the title of Full Force Galesburg
  (thanks JohnP!)
* Some hobbit bits in Black Pear Tree
* Post World Series Cubs in Five updates
* Major additions to Quetzalcoatl Is Born
* The Christianity Today article that cited this site (against all odds)
* The SF Weekly article that referenced my buttons
* A feedback section on the front page
* A link to subscribe to tMG's new mailing list (the Star Chart and
  Almanac)

I had a lot of internal debate as to whether the Ozzy/Black Sabbath songs
warrant their own series. I haven't felt like there's a reason to do that
with wrestling songs, yet, and there's so many themes and topics in tMG
songs that there's a slippery slope to go crazy and have a series for
everything until you no longer have "the Annotated tMG" but "the tMG
Concordance". But I feel it meets a number of criteria: more songs in it
than some other existing series, strong thematic connections, songs that
aren't on a single album, John acknowledging that the songs are connected
(unlike the wrestling songs), and a frequent desire from people who love
tMG to keep track of them. So I've done so --- but there's nothing
official about this, and if people disagree, I'm amenable to backing off
of it and going back to the traditionally acknowleged songs.
