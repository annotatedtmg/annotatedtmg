    "It's twelve new songs: twelve hard lessons the Bible taught me, kind of."
    --- Darnielle, John (2009, July 28). [The Good

[^tlotwtctitle]:
    The title is derived from the closing lines of the Nicene Creed, which in
    the Roman Catholic version states, "... We look for the resurrection of
    the dead, / and the life of the world to come. / Amen." [The Nicene

[^tlotwtcseries]:
    This album and every song on it is part of the [informal series of
    Biblical references](./series.html#bible). Generally, each song would be
    individually referenced to denote this, but as every song on the album
    falls into this category I considered this unnecessary.

### Liner notes ### {#liner}

thanks to the Essenes [^essenes] and peace to the scribes [^scribe].

[^essenes]:
    The [Essenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essenes) were a Jewish
    religious order around 200 BCE to 100 AD from which the Dead Sea Scrolls
    are believed to have originated.

[^scribe]:
    Scribes in Israel were the copiers of the Torah as well as literate
    members of society who performed professional tasks related to being able
    to read, write, and manage documents.

Early preorders of The Life of the World to Come came with a bonus CD of demos
to much of the album (all but 1 Samuel 15:23 and Ezekiel 7 and the Permanent
Efficacy of Grace), both extras, and several outtakes (namely [Daniel 12:8
(third)](flux.html#daniel) and [Matthew 11:14 -- 19](flux.html#matthew11)),
called [The Life of the World in Flux](flux.html). An alternate demo of Daniel
12:8, Daniel 12:8 (first), was later released online. An identically titled
limited live film DVD was also available. A studio version of [Proverbs
6:27](#proverbs) is available on downloads of the album from Amazon, while one
for [Enoch 18:14](#enoch) is available on downloads from iTunes. Finally,
[Bride](online.html#bride) is an outtake.

## 1 Samuel 15:23 [^samueljohn] [^samuel] ## {#samuel}

I became a crystal healer and my ministry was to the sick \\
Creeping vines would send out runners and seek me in their numbers \\
I sold \\
Self-help tapes \\
Go down to the netherworld \\
Plant grapes [^grapes]

And as word spread of my powers, they would seek me far and wide \\
All sad faces at my window, I would welcome them inside \\
I sewed clothes for them \\
Cloaks and capes \\
Go down to the netherworld \\
Plant grapes

My house will be for all people who have nowhere to go \\
My supply of shining crystals a shield against the snow \\
There's more like me where I come from \\
So mark our shapes [^shapes] \\
Go down to the netherworld \\
Plant grapes

    "I do remember at some point I was pretty pleased with myself for saying,
    'Well, this is a song about how I became a crystal healer and my ministry
    was to the sick.'" --- Swedish-American Hall, San Francisco, June 28, 2012

    "This is a song about safe spaces." --- Front Porch Festival, Wente

[^samuel]:
    "For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and defiance is like
    wickedness and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord,
    He has rejected you as king." [1 Samuel 15:23][samuel], Holman Christian
    Standard Bible, retrieved May 16, 2012.

[^grapes]:
    In Greek mythology, Tantalus was punished for his many misdeeds by being
    forced to stand, thirsty and hungry, in a fresh pool with a vine overhead
    full with grapes. When he reached for either the vine or the water, it
    would recede out of his grasp. It is unknown whether this reference was
    intended.

[^shapes]:
    These lines in 1 Samuel 15:23 and Proverbs 6:27 bear a remarkable
    similarity to each other and to the phrase in the [Satanic Messiah liner
    notes](messiah.html#liner). However, I've been unable to find a source for
    the line; if you know, [I'd love to hear from you](../about.html#contact).

    [AKM Adam](http://akma.disseminary.org/about/), theologian and scholar who
    has written about the Mountain Goats, has this to say about these lines:

    > this corresponds to a great extent to John's recurrent allusions to 1 Cor
    > 13:12, though there's obviously a certain difference (or you'd have made
    > the connection explicit). There's no consistent connection between a Greek
    > word and the English gloss "shape", so the reference is harder to track
    > down. HCSB apparently doesn't use "shape" at all in its New Testament (and
    > none of the OT usages seem to fit Darnielle's usage). Among the candidates
    > in Greek, I'd think first of eikôn (image), then homoiôma (likeness),
    > morphê (form), schêma (form), eidos (form, appearance), but none of these
    > seems just right. Interestingly, though, eidos is what Paul uses in 2 Cor
    > 5:7 when he says "we walk by faith, not by sight (dia eidous)." If that's
    > the clue (and it's tenuous), it would connect us again to the
    > eschatological hope of true seeing, possibly connecting to 1 John 3:2,
    > "...what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this:
    > when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is."
    > And, of course, the transformation motif John alludes to in Phil 3:20-21.
    >
    > While Adventists might connect Sunday worship with the Book of Daniel,
    > there's still no conventional phrase "the sign of Daniel" for which one
    > might look. The closest candidate, to my mind, would be the revelation of
    > the Son of Man in Daniel 7:
    >
    > "As I watched in the night visions, \\
    > I saw one like a human being \[Son of Man\] \\
    >     coming with the clouds of heaven. \\
    > And he came to the Ancient One \\
    >     and was presented before him.  \\
    > To him was given dominion \\
    >     and glory and kingship, \\
    > that all peoples, nations, and languages \\
    >     should serve him. \\
    > His dominion is an everlasting dominion \\
    >     that shall not pass away, \\
    > and his kingship is one \\
    >     that shall never be destroyed. "
    >
    > Even then, there's no "sign" one might recognise. That's the case also,
    > though, for "the sign of Jonah", about which I wrote my first published
    > article, so it probably doesn't make a big difference. If it's not the
    > handwriting on the wall, then Daniel himself might be the sign: the
    > prophet in a foreign country, making his way as best he can, trying to
    > keep faith under hostile circumstances.

## Psalms 40:2 [^psalmsjohn] [^psalmsdemo] [^psalms] ## {#psalms}

Pulled off the highway in Missouri and lo, our hearts were heavy-laden [^matthew1128] \\
Made for the chapel with some spraypaint for all the things we'd held in secret \\
Lord, lift up these lifeless bones \\
Light cascading through the windows, all the rainbow's heavy tones \\
He has fixed his sign in the sky [^sign] \\
He has raised me from the pit and set me high [^pit]

Left that place in ruin \\
Drunk on the spirit and high on fumes \\
Checked into a Red Roof [^redroof] then stayed up for several hours and then
    slept like infants \\
In the burning fuselage of my days \\
Let my mouth be ever fresh with praise [^praise] \\
He has fixed his sign in the sky \\
He has raised me from the pit and set me high

Each morning new \\
Each day shot through \\
With all the sharp small shards of shrapnel \\
That seem to burst out of me and you

Head down toward Kansas, we will get there when we get there, don't you worry \\
Feel bad about the things we do along the way but not really that bad \\
We inhaled the frozen air \\
Lord, send me a mechanic if I am not beyond repair \\
He has fixed his sign in the sky \\
He has raised me from the pit and he will set me high

[^psalmsjohn]:
    "This is a story about the transcendental romantic joy of desecrating a
    church with the one you love." --- August 5, 2011, Lollapalooza,
    Playstation Stage, Chicago. John expresses similar banter elsewhere, such
    as at the Troubadour, Los Angeles on December 16, 2011, where he implies
    that the lovers are men.

    This was inspired by Missouri's [Precious Moments
    Chapel](http://www.preciousmomentschapel.org/). 9:30 Club, Washington, DC,
    November 27, 2009.

    John describes this song at some length in a 2009 interview. "I'm...
    saying that your ideas of God will come to rest upon you in your moment of
    profoundest degradation, which is kind of what that song is about." ---

## Genesis 3:23 [^genesis3john] [^genesis3demo] [^genesis3] ### {#genesis3}

House up in Clear Lake [^clearlake] \\
Where I used to live \\
Picked the lock on the front door \\
And felt it give

Touch nothing, move nothing, stand still \\
Keep my ears open for cars \\
See how the people here live now \\
Hope that they're better at it than I was

I used to live here \\
I used to live here \\
I used to live here \\
I used to live here

Pictures up on the mantle \\
Nobody I know \\
I stand by the tiny furnace \\
Where the long shadows grow

Living room to bedroom to kitchen \\
Familiar and warm \\
Hours we spent starving within these walls \\
Sounds of a distant storm

I used to live here \\
I used to live here \\
I used to live here \\
I used to live here

Fight through the ghosts in the hallway \\
Duck and weave \\
Stand by the door with my eyes closed \\
When it's time to leave

Steal home before sunset \\
Cover up my tracks \\
Drive home with old dreams that play in my mind \\
And the wind at my back

Break the lock on my own garden gate \\
When I get home after dark \\
Sit looking up at the stars outside \\
Like teeth in the mouth of a shark

I used to live here \\
I used to live here \\
I used to live here \\
I used to live here

[^genesis3john]:
    John describes this song as being about visiting places where one has
    lived and had intense, disastrous experiences, and specifically about
    breaking and entering houses where one formerly lived.. Listen for example
    to the banter at the Durham Be Easy Festival, August 14, 2009, Durham
    Armory, North Carolina. This is further described in the Breihan 2009
    Pitchfork interview referenced more fully above, in which John describes
    feeling the need to go through his old places in Portland and Claremont as
    a way of coping with abuse.

    The interviewer notes that while John is wanting to revisit abusive or
    destructive households, the verse describes being cast out of Eden. In
    response, John says:

    "Well, everything's Edenic. Everything is. I really don't know what your
    past is like, but I've got to assume, like everyone else, you have plenty
    of pain in it, right? But when you go back to the places where the pain
    was at, you find that there was more stuff there, and that there's stuff
    about it that you miss just because it's you. Because that's who you were,
    and you grow to accept that. When you do that kind of stuff, whether it's
    Eden or not, it is. Every place that you left is Eden in some way."

    from which he was taken." [Genesis 3:23][genesis3], Holman Christian
    Standard Bible, retrieved May 16, 2012.

[genesis3]: http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:23&version=HCSB

[^clearlake]:
    Clear Lake is the name of many towns, but given John's reference to
    Portland it perhaps refers to a unincorporated town near Salem, Oregon
    [(map)][clearlakemap].  However, John refers to his house being near North
    Broadway (Breihan 2009), placing it well within Portland city limits.

    Perhaps more likely is that the town is an homage to [Clear Lake,
    Iowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_Lake,_Iowa), which is only an
    hour or so north of Ames, where John lived while writing the Coroner's
    Gambit. Thanks to Dan Coffey (of Ames himself!) for pointing this out!

    The house in this story may thus be fictional or from another part of his
    life, and could be from one of several states, including California and
    Iowa, both states where John has resided.

## Philippians 3:20 -- 21 [^philippiansjohn] [^philippiansdemo] [^philippians] ## {#philippians}

The path to the awful room \\
That no one will sleep in again \\
Was lit for one man only \\
Gone where none can follow him

Try to look down \\
The way he'd gone \\
Back of the closet whose depths go on \\
And on and on

Nice people said he was with God now \\
Safe in his arms \\
But the voices of the angels that he heard on his last days with us \\
Smoke alarms

Well, the path to the palace of wisdom [^blake] \\
That the mystics walk \\
Is lined with neuroleptics [^psychotropics] \\
And electric shocks

Hope daily for healing \\
Try not to go insane \\
Dance in a circle with bells on \\
Try to make it rain

And nice people said he had gone home to God now \\
Safe in his arms, safe in his arms \\
But the voices of the angels singing to him in his last hours with us \\
Smoke alarms, smoke alarms

[^philippiansjohn]:
    From Breihan 2009, Pitchfork:

    Pitchfork: 'Philippians 3:20 -- 21', that's a verse about how Jesus
    will make your body like his body. That's when you're dying?

    JD: Yes. It's about what happens after you die.

    Pitchfork: That's what you're singing about there?

    JD: The song is actually about a specific person. I'm not going to say
    who, but it's a person of note.

    Pitchfork: Is it Michael Jackson?

    JD: No. \[laughs\] No, I would have to have been pretty fast to have
    written a Michael Jackson song, gotten into the studio, gotten it mastered
    into the sequence and ready for the album. The song is about the conflict
    between what people say happens after we die and the sort of lives we
    live. It's kind of an angry-at-God sort of song. Because you hear of
    people who suffered their entire life that, once they die, now their
    *\[sic\]* won't have bad days, because they're with God. People say that.

    And you think, well, maybe God could have been more merciful and let them
    off the hook earlier. Brought them into this place of no suffering and
    eternal bliss and presence of the most high a lot earlier and saved this
    person a lot of unnecessary pain, instead of having them suffer their
    entire lives. And in the case of people who are so damaged they wind up
    taking their own lives, well, you'd think an all-powerful God could have
    prevented that. It's in the nature of being all-powerful, right? I had a
    specific person in mind. The song is about the sorts of hard questions
    that come up when somebody kills himself.

    A reference to William Blake's
    [The Marriage of Heaven and
    Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marriage_of_Heaven_and_Hell). In

    > In seed-time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy. \\
    > Drive your cart and your plough over the bones of the dead. \\
    > The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.

    The poem celebrates sensual pleasures and earthly feelings as having a
    spiritual place, in contrast to the morals typical of his time.

Blow and burn slowly \\
No ground is ever gonna hold me [^grave]

Bodies reassembling down where the worms crawl \\
Make your own friends when the world's gone cold

If not by faith then by the sword \\
I'm going to be restored

Build the fires to keep the beacon flashing \\
Where the earth lies flat \\
Blood calls to blood as the hours draw down \\
Invent my own family if it comes to that

Hold them close, hold them near \\
Tell them no one's ever going to hurt them here \\
Steal the treasure and try to leave town \\
Fight my way back down

Don't want to hurt anyone \\
Probably gonna have to before it's all done \\
Take to the hills, run away \\
I'm going to get my perfect body back someday \\
If not by faith then by the sword \\
I'm going to be restored

## Genesis 30:3 [^genesis30john] [^genesis30] ## {#genesis30}

For several days the visitors were here \\
We saw them turn down and we watched them disappear \\
Talked about the days they'd said were sure to come \\
Had a hard time believing

I remember seeing you, my tongue struck dumb \\
When you first came here from wherever it was you came from \\
The power in your voice, your rough touch \\
You keeping care of me, keeping watch

Open up the doors to the tent \\
Wonder where the good times went \\
I will do what you ask me to do \\
Because of how I feel about you

I saw his little face contract as his eyes met light \\
Try to imagine anything so bright \\
You only see it once and it steals until the dawn \\
And then it's gone forever

For several hours we lay there, last ones of our kind \\
Harder days coming, maybe, I don't mind \\
Sounds kind of dumb when I say it but it's true \\
I would do anything for you

Open up the promise of the day \\
Drive the dark things away \\
I will do what you ask me to do \\
Because of how I feel about you

    The song is directly about the love in the Biblical story of
    [Jacob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob) and Rachel, who was barren and
    so asked Jacob to sleep with her handmaiden Bilhah so that the two of them
    could raise children together.

    "This is a song about three people who love each other and eventually
    four. People in Biblical times speaking out on the subject of what does
    and doesn't count as marriage, 'cause as it turns out, it's about who you
    love." 9:30 Club, Washington, DC, November 27, 2009. See also Hopscotch,

And confess with your lips \\
Surely you will be saved one day

Look for the sign of Daniel [^signdaniel] \\
Consider the clues \\
Wait as long as I have to for good news

Wake and rise and face the day and try to keep the day from staring back at me \\
Busy hours for joyful hearts and maybe later head out to the pharmacy \\
Won't take the medication but it's good to have around \\

    context, see the quotation referenced in the [Philippians 3:20 -- 21
    footnote](#fn:philippiansjohn).

    Pitchfork: Well, that ties in with "Romans 10:9".

    JD: Yeah, those two *\[referring to Philippians 3:20--21\]* are kind of a
    pair, I feel.

    Pitchfork: That's one of the few songs where you actually have the verse
    in the song. This one says that if you believe, then good things will
    happen to you. It seems to be someone keeping that in their head literally
    when everything in their life is going to shit.

    JD: That is a solid reading. There's a really personal aspect to it, too,
    that I don't want to go into. But that is one of the harder songs on the
    album. The last couple of years have been a challenge for me in a couple
    of ways. But yeah, you have these moments where you look for something to
    reach for. I think that's when people are very vulnerable to joining up
    with religion, when they're looking for some sort of promise. But it's
    also a time when you have to be honest with yourself about how attractive
    those promises are to you personally, not for some other person. The
    notion that you can make some decision to feel a certain way and be
    relieved of some suffering --- that's legit, right? It's not something to
    be scoffed at or dismissed lightly.

    Pitchfork: Yeah, I mean, that's kind of the whole idea behind believing,
    right? That's how my dad always explained it to me.

    JD: Yeah. Because there is going to be a lot of suffering. So it would be
    nice to think that it won't have been in vain.

    No clear sign of Daniel exists in the Bible or religious practice,
    according to A.K.M. Adam. Adam suggests that John is referring to "the

    there are several other possible signs in the [Book of
    Daniel](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+1&version=HCSB).

    Another possible interpretation involves the [Eternal Gospel
    Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Gospel_Church), an extreme
    sect of Seventh-day Adventism, which holds that changing the Sabbath from
    Saturday to Sunday is a mark of the Antichrist. They gained notoriety by
    purchasing billboard space throughout the United States proclaiming that
    this Mark of the Beast is stated in [Daniel
    7:25](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%207:25&version=HCSB):
    "He will speak words against the Most High and oppress the holy ones of
    the Most High. He will intend to change religious festivals and laws, and
    the holy ones will be handed over to him for a time, times, and half a
    time."

In the holding tank I built for myself \\
It's feeding time \\
And I start to feel afraid 'cause I'm the last one left in line \\
The endless string of summer storms that led me to today \\
Began one afternoon with you long ago and far away

And someone leads the beast in on its chain \\
But I know you're thinking of me 'cause it's just about to rain \\
So I won't be afraid of anything ever again

In the cell that holds my body back \\
The door swings wide \\
And I feel like someone's lost child as the guards lead me outside \\
And if the clouds are gathering it's just to point the way \\
To an afternoon I spent with you when it rained all day

And someone leads the beast in on its chain \\
But I know you're thinking of me 'cause it's just about to rain \\
So I won't be afraid of anything ever again

## Matthew 25:21 [^matthewjohn] [^matthewdemo] [^matthew] ## {#matthew}

They'd hooked you up \\
To a fentanyl drip [^fentanyl] \\
To mitigate the pain a little bit \\
I flew in \\
From Pennsylvania \\
When I heard the hour was coming fast \\
And I docked in Santa Barbara \\
Tried to brace myself \\
But you can't brace yourself when the time comes \\
You just have to roll with the blast

And I'm an eighteen-wheeler headed down the interstate \\
And my brakes are gonna give and I won't know till it's too late \\
Tires screaming when I lose control \\
Try not to hurt too many people when I roll

Find the Harbor Freeway [^harbor] \\
And head south \\
Real tired \\
Head kind of light \\
I found Telegraph Road [^telegraph] \\
I'd only seen the name on envelopes \\
Found the parking lot \\
And turned right

I felt all the details \\
Carving out space in my head \\
Tropicanas on the walkway \\
Neon red \\
Between the pain and the pills trying to hold it at bay \\
Stands a traveler going somewhere far away

And I am an airplane tumbling wing over wing \\
Try to listen to my instruments, they don't say anything \\
People screaming when the engines quit \\
I hope we're all in crash position when we hit

And then came to your bedside \\
And as it turns out, I'm not ready \\
And as though you were speaking through a thick haze \\
You said hello to me \\
We all stood there around you \\
Happy to hear you speak \\
The last of something bright burning, still burning \\
Beyond the cancer and the chemotherapy

And you were a presence full of light upon this earth \\
And I am a witness to your life and to its worth \\
It's three days later when I get the call \\
And there's nobody around to break my fall [^stillaround]

[^matthewjohn]:
    From the 2009 Pitchfork interview:

    Pitchfork: 'Matthew 25:21' is pretty explicitly about watching someone die
    of cancer.

    JD: Yeah, that one is about my mother-in-law. Straight autobiographical
    song. It's about the time that I --- oh man, it's hard to talk about.
    It's about the time that I called my wife from tour, and she had gone to
    be with her mom and she said, 'We're thinking it could come any minute.' I
    was on tour, and I couldn't not go say goodbye, so I canceled a show in
    Northampton, Massachusetts and flew home, drove in and stayed in that
    environment where someone is about to leave their body at a very young
    age. I was there for about 24 hours, and then I turned around and went
    back to tour and stepped from a cab onto stage. It was really disorienting
    in a really heavy, heavy way. So yeah. That's for her.

        nor the Fairies, nor all of Titania! They must see Hell firsthand. \\

        world's demise --- just like the prophecies, the lid to Hell opens.
