# Contributing #

There's lots to do for the site, and I always appreciate contributions, even
if it takes a long time for me to get to them. This page outlines some of the
next steps for the site if you're interested in helping out.

If you have suggestions, comments, corrections, or other edits, please send
them in. Minor edits, such as fixing typos, correcting syntax, repairing dead
links, maintaining stylistic consistency, improving semantics, and so on, are
encouraged. You can make these changes via git (either through the GitHub
browser interface or using git directly) or [email me][contact]. It's easier
to quickly process submissions via git, but either works and both are
appreciated. There's a brief guide to the site and its syntax in the
[README][repo].

If you're interested in contributing in a larger way, thank you! Two major
ways are to contribute lyrics that aren't yet up, and to annotate songs or
albums that have yet to be analyzed. The lists below show what work remains to
be done. You can also look at the [site index][tamg] which denotes the albums
lacking lyrics and annotations with *italics* and a plus (+) or dash (-)
respectively. There are also some [programming needs](#programming),
[translations to be done](#translations), and [missing source
material](#missing-source-material), if you happen to have knowledge or
resources in those domains.

I approach the site as an evidence-based research project aimed at
understanding the intent behind the source material, which is what
differentiates it from other more speculative endeavors. As a consequence of
this, none of the material is copied from elsewhere, and all of it is
personally verified. When contributing, please do not copy and paste,
particularly from other lyrics websites, as these tend to be error-prone and
this approach runs the risk of copyright infringement.

Contributing lyrics is usually straightforward and these can be uploaded
quickly after a brief verification process on my end. I greatly appreciate
annotations but cannot incorporate them quickly as that process is much more
involved. Thank you in advance for your patience and please know your efforts
are valued even if months pass before they are added to the site.

## Programming ##

If you're a Ruby programmer, and can contribute to Jekyll, I would love your
help and suggestions fixing [bug #8886][jekyll-bug], which currently (minorly)
impacts the site.

## Translations ##

If you speak Japanese, I would love your help translating the [All Eternals
Deck Japanese liner notes][aed-japanese]. These liner notes might help
understand All Eternals Deck better, as was seen with the notes to [On Juhu
Beach][juhu] and [Get Lonely][gl]. You can see some of the context in the
[relevant footnote][aed-fn].
